#New Aesthetic, New Anxieties by Dave Berry

It's 2011,and I have no idea what anything is or does anymore.(Taylor,in Bridle 2011c) 
How do we think about media art aesthetics and the production of critical knowledge as the creative industries paradigm consolidates around us, amidst ongoing financial, environmental and political crises? Can we still claim a special place for media art given the increasing ubiquity of informational technologies in everyday life and the intensification of cultural distribution through social media platforms? This book reflectsonthesequestionsthroughtherecent NewAesthetic.Morespecifically,we are interested in reflecting on why a notion developed by the British designer James Bridle caused such a reaction across multiple contexts, sectors and segments of network culture. Pitched as a highly-curated batch of crowdsourced visual and textual content on the commercial microblogging and social networking platform Tumblr, the New Aestheticwaspresented as a 'shareable concept',a 'theoryobject'.This collection, moreover, was delivered with a message: the machines were telling us something, trying to speak to us, and we just need to return their affectionate, surveillant gazes, and communicate with their program languages. 
The term New Aesthetic felt the full force of love and hate from a disparate crew of writers, media art theorists and practitioners, designers, object-oriented ontologistsandcuratorsinanoutpouringof frenziedattentionandcriticism.Ironically, evenambivalent responseswerewelldocumented.Sinceitsexplosiononline,many have relegated the phenomena of the New Aesthetic to the status of a 'non-event.' But how could such a thing be both phenomenal and superfluous, attracting so many contributions, sightings, parallels and revisionist accounts, including from new media practitioners themselves? The question of how and why the New Aesthetic became emblematic of a particular kind of sensibility, one arguably characteristic of a disruptive network culture, is the subject of this book. 
Approaching this topic, we want to think through the anxieties, misunderstandings, arguments,bruisedegosandskirmishestheNewAestheticgenerated.Weattempt to move beyond lazy thinking, positions of pious indifference or naive enthusiasm, and ask what the New Aesthetic might tell us about this juncture in which find ourselves, ascurators,critics,artiststheoristsandcreativeworkers.Weespeciallywant to explore the discomfort and challenges of the New Aesthetic for a number of commentators working in proximity to 'new media aesthetics.' Somehow the New Aesthetic as a point of conversation seemed to generate strong boundary anxieties at a time when media art and the cultural sector in general, here in the Netherlands and across Europe, are having serious difficulties conceiving of present conditions and futurevisionsof theirown.Especiallyconsideringthisfact,thesenseof beautific sentimentality and foreboding captured by its images, along with the distributive attention it attracted, raises interesting questions for the future of new media art. 
The first section of this book provides some definitions and introduces key themes. 

This is followed by a series of reflections by curators on how curatorial practice and expertise in proximity to the New Aesthetic makes sense of its objects, forms and artifacts.We then move to conceptuallysituate the New Aesthetic-as one kind of emergent aesthetic form -into a broader episteme of computationality and periodisationof neoliberalgovernmentality.Thisisanattempt toexpandour perspective on what the New Aesthetic might mean, and also consider how media art can reimagine itself by asking some difficult new questions. 
WHAT WAS THE NEW AESTHETIC? 
Defining the New Aestheticisnecessarily problematic.It's a vibe,an attitude,a feeling, a sensibility.Posted to the blog for The Really Interesting Group -a creative design partnership based in East London -Bridle introduced the term on May 6th, 2011 by stating: 
For a while now, I've been collecting images and things that seem to approach a New Aesthetic of the future, which sounds more portentous thanImean.What I mean is that we've got frustrated with the NASA extropianism space-future, the failure of jetpacks, and we need to see the technologieswe actually have witha new wonder.Considerthis a mood-board for unknown products. 
(Someof thesethingsmight haveappearedhere,ornearby,before.They are not necessarily new new, but I want to put them together.) 
For so long we’ve stared up at space in wonder, but with cheap satellite imagery and cameras on kites and RC helicopters, we're looking at the ground withnew eyes,to see structures and infrastructures.(Bridle 2011a) 
The post contained a series of digital images documenting this sensibility associated of the future.These visual artefacts included satellite imagery, tracking of geotagged data from iPhones, the location of Osama Bin Laden's 'hideout' on Google Maps from a New York Times article, splinter camouflage on military jets, the Telehouse West data center in East London by YRM Architects and 'low res' industrial design by United Nude,amongothers.At a glance,these appear as a randomset of images.Indeed, something about it recalls what ADILKNO once described as vague media, "their models are not argumentative,but contaminative. Once you tune in to them, you get the attitude. But that was never their intention; their vagueness is not an ideal, it is the ultimate degree of abstraction". However, perhaps the reference to mood boards is more telling, a highly contemporary technique of concepting integral to creative labourin advertising and design settings.This is a culturaltechnology which involves creating an 'atmosphere' or context for consumption around a product Explicitly for Bridle, it is something designed for network culture to take up: for him, the products are 'unknown.' In this respect, it aims purely to evoke a potential atmosphere around standard infrastructure. It performs a sense of notional space,but not anaturalsublime.Onthecontrary,theNewAestheticsstrivestostare down a thoroughly hybridized socio-technological world 
In his original pitch, Bridle reflects on digital and networked technologies from the weirdperspectiveof afatherfigureforthemachinesinthestyleof AlanTuring.For Bridle, childmachines' should be educated not through Turing's politically incorrect method of punishment and rewards,but through positive reinforcement,care and creative communicative strategies. Let's be frank,there is an urgent need to interrogate computational processes, but Bridle's kitsch affection for thinking machines is ultimately underpinned by a political naivety that could perhaps only be maintained by the creative classes.The socio-politicalasymmetries perpetuated by data-mining, the privatized social graph, facial recognition technologies, drone attacks, and camouflage are swept aside by the positive message to make the world "more exciting, make it better" (2011c). 
We're not surprised any longer by the political aporias of the creative sector -even whilst they claim an ethical stance. We aim to take the New Aesthetic in other directions; we're interested in intersecting practices or ecologies, technical critiques and questions of medium-specificity in the computational episteme. We're curious about unknown products, especially as it relates to a potential for producing new spaces for the common. But rather than fixating on Bridle's pitch, let's find some other angles and approaches into this vague terrain. Let's follow some practices, discourses and criticisms associated with the New Aesthetic, refigure distinctions between expert and layman,the commercialand the noncommercial,the properand improper.Let's build some critical feedback loops along these confusing trajectories. 
ALGORITHMIC AGENTS 
Recent debates over the 'correct' use of algorithms can help us start to define the NewAestheticinusefulways.Last February,Norwegianborn,NYC-basedartist generative artist Marius Watz posted a brief article on his Tumblr that was intended to act as a warning sign and wake-up call to his peers -the community of artists and designers for whom the medium of computer code is their working toolset. He wrote,  Yes,heavy use of standard algorithms is bad for you. That is,it is if you wish to consider yourself a computational creative capable of coming up with interesting work...You cannot lay claim to 'owning' any given algorithm (or hardware configuration), unless you have added significant extra value to it.To do so is at best ignorant...This doesn't mean you shouldn't experiment with great algorithms.
In effect this was a critique of what Watz called "algorithmic laziness" and seemed to be an attempt to sketch the contours of acceptable algorithmic use in artistic practice. As Bruce Sterling (2012a) commented, "A 'canon of algorithms.' What an intriguing development." 
It is helpful to know a bit more about Watz to understand the relevance of his commentsandtofeelhisconcern.Hehasworkedinthemediumof thealgorithmic image for the last decade, taking his practice to countless festivals and events in the global new media circuit as he progressively executed a transition to the gallery scene. 
Jumping from the medium of the screen and the projection to more tangible outputs, last year he became the first 'Artist in Residence' at Makerbot industries, the open-source, VC-backed company that produces the most affordable and popular 3D printer.Watz is slowly becominga familiar sight in hacking spaces and mostly-Western art and technology institutions. 
Instead of choosing the comfortable position of an artist who concentrates on their ownworkandwon't intervene in debates, Marius Watz frequently contributes. As an evangelist of the generative, he started the Generator-X conference showcasing latest generative strategies and software processes in digital art, architecture and design, has curated several software art exhibitions and teaches frequently coding and modeling workshops forbeginners,freelancers and professionals. While modest, he is also very opinionated, and will enjoy a (polite and good humored) polemic on blogs, socialnetworks and mailing lists now and then.This is just to say that Watz really cares about code, and has great expectations about its role in art practices today.Hedoesn't want his great love,the computated image,to be banalized or the tools of his trade to be used poorly. Some of the most determinant of these tools are, probably, algorithms. 
From this perspective, the entry posted on February 13, 2012 on his Tumblr titled 'The Algorithm Thought Police', was a sincere effort to unpack the problematic relationship between the artist who writes code and the larger entities that she manipulates to produce a visual output. Because these entities,in his words, 
Are not neutral vessels. Algorithms provide themeans to produces pecific outcomes, typically through generative logic or data processing. But in the process they leave their distinct footprints on theresult. 'speaking' through algorithms, your thought patterns and modes of expression are shaped by their syntax.(Watz 2012a) 
These entities -lists of instructions that calculate a function -would be easy to recognize,if not name,bymost citizensinwesternsocietiestoday.Becausethey codify through their outputs a specific, increasingly ubiquitous texture of reality, a skin that's being overlaid in buildings, fashion, cars, jewelry, print publications, and chairs. 
A list of the creative coder's 'problematic friends', in Watz's affectionate term, would include, among many others: Circle Packing (which define an area in circles progressively without letting them enter in contact, until the area is completely covered), Polygon subdivision (different techniques of splitting an area in polygonal shapes) and boids (the simulations of the behavior of birds flocking); or voronoi, which is "the partitioning of a plane with n points into convex polygons such that each polygon contains exactly one generating point and every point in a given polygon is closer to its generating point than to any other" (Bhattacharya and Gavrilova 2008: 202) 
Algorithms are a technical aspect of the medium within which the New Aesthetic is being created, used, disseminated and remediated. Watz's concerns point us to issues of technical literacies, know-how, categories of distinction and boundary conditionsthat are necessary for establishing newmodes of critique. The same concerns regarding the use of tools, forms, and the creative treatment of digital objects, the politics of their management and so on, seem to circulate everywhere across various academic and artistic scenes that are literate in computation and politics.In our current conditions,these questions of medium-specificity, material access to devices and techniques of interrogability that support the development of media art practice themselves face new challenges. Processes of obfuscation, the refrain of efficiency, intellectual property regimes, built-in obsolesence, censorship and surveillance form part of a wider constitutive context through which these practices become politicized.In V2_’s recent publication Vital Beauty, Dutch media art critic Arjen Mulder makes explicit the stakes of this scenario, 
All the signs indicate that technological art will succumb to current social pressure and becoming something usefulto people and the economy.In the process, we will lose part of what I will call the intellectual life of our times: the extent to which we are able to be conscious of the present. Artists are not creative in the sense of constantly coming up with new content.Rather,they change the form,the medium,the framework.In their hands, form is elevated to method, media become cocreators, and blueprints turn into diagrams.(Mulder2012) 
What isinterestingabout creativeexperimentationwhichisconsciousof toolsand politics is what new forms of critical art try to gather up and deal with: the complexity of our incontrovertibly aesthetic negotiations of things. 
Whether radical, formalist, corporate or fascist, aesthetics compose subjects in a contract withtechnological,politicalandeconomicrealities.Inthisway,newformsof sense and perception offer up different ways of thinking about our intimate attachmentstothehistoricalspecificityof theworld.Inthissense,theyarealsoforms of publicityforspecifickindsof comportment.AlreadywithFuturismandthehistorical avant-garde, artworks’ proximity to publicity worked to disrupt and deregulate cultural valuesthroughtheshocksof modernity.TheNewAesthetic,however,doesnot present amodernist manifesto,norinvent anautonomousaestheticgrammar.Rather, the New Aesthetic exists as a Tumblr that evokes particular subjectivities; a cascade of images, a collection, an archive, or more specifically, a database that attempts to document a certain unfolding condition. 
This condition in question is precisely the age of the algorithm, or the regime of computation(Golumbia2009).ForSterling,it captured“aneruptionof thedigitalinthe physical”, (2012b) for David Berry, this was an attempt to “see the grain of computation” (2012a).The New Aestheticsignifiesthe digitaland computation throughimagefiles.That is,theTumblraccumulatesrepresentationsof pixels, standardized objects, calculative operations and other instantiations of applied mathematics. 
Somewhat paradoxically, however, as the New Aesthetic attempts to document the 'reality' of this condition -the ubiquity of computational processes -it remains caught inthecomputationalregimeitself.Thisismost obviousthroughtheemphasisonvisual knowledge and in the tension that exists between representation and mediation in software(Chun2011).TheNewAestheticattemptstorepresent theconditionof computationality,but doesnot reflect onitsownstatusasmedia.ThisiswhytheNew Aestheticseemstoevokewhat alreadywas,ratherthanwhat might be.Indeed,if the New Aesthetic suggests a particular subject, as we go on to discuss, it would be more accuratelydescribed as desubjectified,orpartial.Defined more by intensitiesthan by consciousness or action, which are deprioritized or unavailable, this is comparable to what Tiqqun call the Bloom (2000), but we describe under computationality as the riparian user (Berry2011).However,wewant tosuggest that thisisnot somecritical failure of the New Aesthetic (it was never trying to be otherwise); rather, it can be taken as a generalized symptom of disassociated relations that are characteristic of software, bound by the logic of computation. 
It is a related concern that the computational regime is operative during a phase when the post-89 market-driven social and economic reforms of neoliberalism have come into crisis, impacting upon our comportment in the present as producers, critics and everydaynegotiatorsof cultureat large.Thisisanother,untilrecently,obfuscated paradigm of production for today's fine art and creative industrialwork.As a neoclassical economic approach to governmentality, it stresses the efficiency of private enterprise, delimits the state’s role in providing from public services through a politicsof riskprivatizationandsocialdisinvestment.Aswelfarestateagendasare deemed outmoded, in the view of its historian's like David Harvey, neoliberalism names the deepening penetration of processes and regimes of capitalization into political and socialinstitutions – and indeed,culturalconsciousness (2007).On manylevels it is not a changed capitalism, merely an intensified, pernicious version of real subsumption.But itsdifference,trackedearlyin1979byFoucault in The Birth of Biopolitics (2008), is the way in which the latter has succeeded in creating greatest conceptual distance between the state, corporate takeovers of wealth, and the conceptionof the'free'liberaldemocraticimaginaryof citizenship.Thisfreedomrises into its own ethic above all other political imperatives, and cultural logics. 
For affect theorist Lauren Berlant, both art and popular cultural experiments process the present of our neoliberal, networked relations and their conditions of possibility (2011).Aesthetic relationstake shape as trackable 'genres' orformswhichenable contemporary subjects to attach to and at least inhabit the contradictions and ambivalenceof thisNow.Agenre,perhapsespeciallywhenpitchedas'new' (pertaining to now) offers us a recognizable form that we can "groove with" or hold onto, so that we modulate and adjust to the present in the form of affective contracts upon encounters withpeople and things.Genres,significantly,can be bothefforts towards, and defenses from, more politicized ways of thinking and feeling through the present. 
Most relevantly, Berlant has taken up these approaches to aesthetic forms to replace the persistent legacy approaches to aesthetics inherited from modernism that are very muchunsuitedtothinkingthroughmomentsof ongoingcrises.InBadiou,forexample, events throw us into a new present, supposedly rendering old tools, categories and analytics,includingpoliticalanalytics,supposedlyobsolete(2009).Berlant de-dramatizes this to suggest contrarily that the present moment is increasingly being experiencedastheimpositionof asenseof extendedcrisis.Incidentsdon't infact shock us differently, the drama in fact is the opposite of this; things more tend to pile up and we navigate them in a mode of adjustment that itself feels as permanent as it does precarious (2011).Forher,new aesethetic genres invested in the political,the ones that in some way actually respond to, ride on, or aim to make sense of crisis, are also becoming increasinglyreflexive.She tracks and theorizes suchnew genresas different instantiations of dealing with what is unfolding about the present’s political scenes.Thisconsciouslypoliticalinvestment innewgenres,whichweshare (differently between us) as curators, critics, writers and media theorists, connects us sensually to the pursuit of productive knowledge; indeed it is an attempt to bring consciousness and knowledge more in line, rather than experience these as glitched(2011).Wepayattentiontonewformsof art andaestheticencountersothat something,indeedanything,about thepresent might becomemoreknowable.Here especially, the New Aesthetic poses a particularly interesting case for understanding the politics of aesthetic attachments to form in the technocultural present. 
Deleuze and Guattari, reflecting on the state of philosophical thought in their late work, expressed deep concern that “the most shameful moment” had already come “when computer science, marketing, design and advertising, all the disciplines of communication, seized hold of the word concept itself and said: 'This is our concern, we are the creative ones, we are the ideas men!' We are friends of the concept, we put it inourcomputers"(1994:10).Thereshouldbenodoubt that theNewAesthetic arisesfromacertain'creativecontext'.But theNewAestheticisalsoanestranged idea,a"bastard"of sortsbornfromnetworkculture.Besidesappropriatingalready•existing content, it's trajectory was driven by collective emailing, tweeting, posting and commenting.Bridlehimself wouldnotebeforeeventuallyclosingtheTumblr,"it'sa rubbishname,but it seemstohavetakenon"(2012c).Tobesure,theNewAesthetic has enthusiasts, but there is also a real sense that it is a resented and unwanted child. It comes from the wrong parentage (creatives, Wired, SxSw, commercial design), and hasbeensubject toridicule,mockeryandoutright dismissal.However,beingbornout of these conditions, it provokes confusion and discomfort that does not easily dissipate.ContraDeleuzeandGuattari(orperhaps,toput it moreaccurately,inthe spirit of their thought), we need to now reconsider the conditions of possibility for concept productionhere.Thereisnosimplesolution,onlyproblemsandquestions,to which we now turn to examine. 
4. NEW ANXIETIES 

The #tumblresque is not John Berger's Ways of Seeing but sprays of seeing. (Wark 2012) 
What is it about the New Aesthetic that makes you so damn uneasy? There’s a deeply intriguing quality about the New Aesthetic that is more remarkable than any of itsmerits:it cannot beignored.SinceBruceSterling’sfirst essaypopularizedtheterm, the Tumblr that stood as its main platform of communication, and the group of ideas, references and icons that its originators gathered under its umbrella have been refuted,dissected,mocked,celebratedorlaughedat.Thosewhohavefelt obligedto enter the debate about the New Aesthetic come from philosophy, from new media art practice and curation,frominteraction design orfromthe digitalhumanities.But almost no one has passed on the opportunity to say something; nobody has just shruggedwithindifferenceandsaid'theycan’t bebothered'.Thefact of thematteris, everyone seems bothered, somehow. 
This needs to be investigated because, quite clearly, it says something about the stateof thesedisciplinesandthosewhoareworkingtodayinthisculturalspace.While it would be almost impossible to find any unconditional apologist for Bridle's proposition,it’sevenhardertofindindifferent commentators.WhatevertheNew Aesthetic is, it's a set of ideas that can make you feel twitchy and uncomfortable, for a range of reasons depending on who you are: the academic, the digital curator, the newmediaartist.Whetherwecallit abrandorahalf-formedbodyof theory,it reflects back insecurities, biases, or feelings of inadequacy as often as it attracts valid critical responses. 
But what would happen if we properly embraced the New Aesthetic as a topic for network culture? It is claimed the term refers to a 'new nature', and as Haraway reminds us, references to nature inevitably raise questions of the common, "we turn to this topic to orderourdiscourse,to compose ourmemory ...to reinhabit, precisely, common places -locations that are widely shared, inescapably local, worldly, enspirited;that is,topical.Inthissense,natureistheplaceinwhichtorebuildpublic culture"(Haraway2004:65).TheNewAesthetichastemporarilylit upanddisturbed network culture, not only in terms of common concerns, but as a gauge of the state of net discourse.Theseanxieties,moreover,canbe useful, especially in what Matthew Fuller and Andrew Goffey describe as the collision of grey media and grey matter, where “the cracks, faults and disturbances marking our mental universes offer the same kinds of opportunities for exploitation as do bugs in the algorithmic universes of software, and one stratagem is always in the position of being able to turn anotherto its own account” (2010:157).Let's dig into some responses,and diagnose the health of the current debate. 
If we examine the New Aesthetic as an anxious topic, the process comes with its own perils.WhatevergoalBridlehadwhenheopenedtheNewAestheticTumblr,it was 
inevitably affected -maybe derailed -when Sterling posted his essay to Beyond the Beyond blogat Wired.comonApril2,2012.Manyof theanswersandadditional commentary, while insightful, ignored that this notion was a work in process, an atmosphere or mood, a temporary litany of findings, and not a final and definitive statement. 
Sterling's initial post set the tone for the considerable debate that followed, by both claiming this project as a 'serious' avant-garde arising from British media designers, whileacknowledgingitsshortcomingsonatheoreticallevel.Of course,Sterlingshares an investment with Bridle in science fiction and future-thinking, and there was more than a little wish-fulfillment here, although expressed in a satirical register. Nevertheless, the urgency of the New Aesthetic was the major aspect of the essay itself: 
I've seen some attempts along this line before, but this one has muscle. The New Aesthetic is moving out of its original discovery phase, and into a evangelical, podium-pounding phase. If a pioneer village of visionary creatives is founded, and they start exporting some startling, newfangled imagery, like a Marcel Duchamp-style explosion-in-a-shingle-factory… Well, we’ll once again be living in heroic times! (Sterling 2012b) 
Other positive attributes were listed: that the New Aesthetic is 'telling the truth', 'culturally agnostic', 'comprehensible', 'deep', 'contemporary', 'requires close attention', 'constructive'and 'generational'(2012b).His piece worked hard to mythologize the 'movement' through the legitimacy of a modernist canon, citing Russian Constructivists,FrenchImpressionists,Italian Futurists; even adding a comparison of Bridle to Andre Breton-style Pope of this emergent scene. 
However, Sterling also noted a number of considerable downsides or troubling aspects.Beyondrecognizingthemessinessof theaccumulativeTumblrformat,these mainlyrevolvedaroundthelackof rigoroustheoreticalanalysisandcomprehension.In particular, the fact that many of the images refer to radically different phenomena and issues -splinter camouflage, for instance, is not about computational vision, but the physiology of human perception -and almost none of these can be easily indexed backtoaTuringnotionof artificialintelligenceorthinkingmachines.Onthecontrary, the imagery generated by the machines is a profoundly human problem: 
I hasten to assure you that I’m not making lame vitalist claims that our human reactions are mystical, divine, immaterial, timeless or absolute in truth.Iammerelystating,asastarkanddemonstrablefact,that our machineshavenosuchreactions.Torelyonthemtodothat forusis fraudulent.(Sterling 2012b) 
The real trouble here, as Sterling notes, is that this conceptual framework hinders the development of an aesthetic agenda grounded by the specific material workings of these technologies.More concerningly,as we also observed in the introduction,it obfuscates the political problems perpetuated by these digital and networked systems.Thesecriticalcomments,inanycase,wereforthemost part lost inthe discourse on the new aesthetic that followed his essay, which tended to follow the 'heroic'narrative.If thenewaestheticis'collectivelyintelligent',thenSterling'sessay worked to propane-fuel this intellectual discourse. 
The new aesthetic inevitably raised questions around its novelty, historicity, ontologicalbasis,genderbias,politics.Here,a centralconcern was the 'new'in the new aesthetic itself, what does 'newness' refer? Marius Watz, writing on the Creator's Project in a series of responses to Sterling’s essay, argued the case that this aspect was deceptive, "most of what NA offers up for examination is not all that new. Technologies like machine vision and geo-location are old by most standards” (2012b). In his reading, a sense of everyday practices and the ubiquity of digital and networked systems were claimed as distinctive instead: “what is new is their integration into our lives to the point where we are bringing them to bed” (2012b). 
Moreover, if aesthetics can be taken as a sensibility related to a transition in the pervasiveness of computation, then this experience is one that is equally wraught by anxietiesordisturbances.AsWatz putsit, 
This is the new Aesthetic -human behavior augmented by technology as 
oftenasit isdisrupted.TheNewAestheticisasignsaying'Translation 
ServerError'ratherthan'Post Office'.TheNewAestheticisfacesglowing 
ominously as people walk down the street at night staring at their phones •
or worse, their iPads (Watz 2012b). 
Indeed, disruption and augmentation can even be generalized beyond this phenomenological state, given increasing transformations associated with software infrastructures throughout everyday life (Dodge and Kitchin 2011), and the pressures theyhavebrought tobearoninstitutionalforms(Lovink2012).Inotherwords,if there is a sensibility, it becomes one of experiencing the large-scale 'breakdown' carried along by socio-technological processes at large. 
In the recognition of this shifting ground, a number of reactionary responses immediately arose regarding the relation between media art and this wider condition signalledbythenewaesthetic.Inthiscontext,MezBreeze,apractionerof code poetry and artist involved in early net.art, raised concerns regarding the appropriative dynamicsof newaestheticsinitsroleasanaggregativelitanyof digitalimages.Using the term, 'The Phrase That Shall Not Be Named', the specific act of labelling work was criticized as an act of assembling cultural capital, 'cred value', 'ego aggrandrisement', or cultural capital capable of being monetized: "name the new art phase in order to perform/get x" (2012). 
This process was understood as raising a series of questions around cultural ownership and attribution: "to employ a relevant phrase: it just smells wrong" (2012). Indeed, for Breeze, the 'faux-trendoid label' problematically grouped together a series of practices, techniques and approaches to digital and networked technologies that had much longer histories and were related to competing conceptual frameworks and discourses: "appropriating + remixing graphic markers/standards from marginalised or 'other-fied'disciplines/decadesdoesnot anewgenre/paradigmmake"(2012).Her position raises important questions around both the histories and immediate future of mediaart practices.Nevertheless,gesturingtothedynamicsof concept generationin network cultures ("and so it goes"), she would conclude with the highly pious note: "this too will pass" (2012). 
But how satisfying is this familiar claim that media art is playing a long game, so that any emerging developments can merely be ignored, and business can continue as usual? Certainly, the traditional resources and funding that have supported media art are quickly evaporating or, at least, they are increasingly held in question; but there is also a larger ongoing question of the role of these artistic practices in a period of pervasive computation.In a provocative set of secondary remarks on the topic, effectively rubbing salt into the wound, Sterling declared on his blog, 
It may be, that after a long generation of 'New Media,' 'computer art,' 'digital art,' 'device art,' 'net.art,' 'code art,' and similar always-new pseudonyms,we’ve found a betterperspective.We’ve paid a billin blood andstruggle,andagenerationalshift hasoccurred.It’slikewatchinga generation slog it out in the muddy barbed wire, and then seeing a drone appearoverhead...Thebarbed-wireandbayonet eraof net-art isover.It is onewithYpresandVerdunnow,anditstrencheswillfillinwithgrass.It will neverreturn.(Sterling 2012c) 
Such commentary strategically disregarded any distinction between the design context of Bridle and media art practices for the purposes of pursuing an agenda of algorithmic art. 
Elsewhere, the cultural politics of curatorial work was a major strand in this discussion.Christiane Paulposted on the empyre mailing list, 
I have a hard time even seeing the novelty of the 'new aesthetic' construct -as many people on CRUMB have pointed out, it stands in the tradition of many strands of artistic practice that have developed over decades.CTheoryorTurbulencehavecertainlyestablishedalot more (curatorial) context for approaching digital works than the 'new aesthetic' tumblr.Tumblritself,withitsfocusonthelatest post,seemstohave decontextualizing tendencies. 
On a larger scale and along the lines of Nicholas Carr's The Shallows, I'm interested in how the online environment, which seems so deeply contextual by nature, can also obliterate context through the privileging of 'the latest post' rather than a dialogue and "deep" crosslinking of ideas. (Paul 2012) 
Meanwhile, in a highly conservative response to the term, Robert Jackson drew a line between Bridle's 'low' social media and 'high' media art practices, noting "the triteness of usingTumblrasthe'officialsite'"(2012).Immediatelyevident inthetitleof his contribution, 'The Banality of the New Aesthetic', Jackson stated explicitly: "memes require instant satisfaction.Art requires depth" (2012). 
More radical enthusiasm about the New Aesthetic came from Greg Borenstein, who suggestedthat whenviewedthroughObject OrientedOntology(OOO),theNew Aesthetic is a “visible eruption of the mutual empathy between us and a class of new objectsthat arenativetothe21st century”(2012).TheNewAesthetic,inthiscase, can supposedly “help us imagine the inner lives of our digital objects” picking up on the “pigeon language” that takes place “between their inaccessible inner lives and ours” (2012).Like Bridle,Borenstein is enamoured withhow suchartifacts capture “the trace of interaction designers, surveillance drones, gesture recognition systems, fashion designers, image compression techniques, artists, CCTV networks, and filmmakers all wondering about one another without getting confirmation” (2012). 
This line of thought was continued by games designer and theorist Ian Bogost, who argued that the new aesthetic should expand its apparent "correlationalist" interest in human relations and embrace the possibilities of an expansive more-than-human ontology: "to my eyes, the New Aesthetic could use a dose of good, old-fashioned twentiethcenturyimmodesty.Not naïvefascismorimpulsiveradicalism,but bigger eyes,largerhopes,weirdergoals" (2012).Drawing fromthe object-oriented ontology position outlined in his recently published book Alien Phenomenology (2012), Bogost's intervention argued on the terms of OOO for a consideration of relations between things, rather than an exclusive interest in digital and networked technologies and human sense and perception, or anthropocentric categories of beauty – for an alien aesthetics,asit were.This,hesuggested,pointstothefact that NAonlycoversa selective interest in the vast metaphysical dimensions of the real, a point conveyed througha(Latourian)litanyof otherpotentialthingstoconsideraestheticrelations between: "airports, sandstone, koalas, climate, toaster pastries, kudzu, the International 505 racing dinghy, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, the brand name 'TaB'" (2012).Sufficetosay,OOOisinterestingandraisessignificant controversies,but here we are not interested in producing litanies, and hold concerns regarding the politics of the OOO project (Berry 2012; Galloway 2012; Golumbia 2012, Parikka 2011).Indeed,thisisasignificant andcontesteddiscussion,onlytangentialto this New Aesthetic, New Anxieties project, and therefore, perhaps, a topic for another time. 
If the New Aesthetic hit the blogosphere as a shareable concept or theory object, it took some time for female responders to point out that the zeitgeist was the investments of “a whole lot of men doing the looking, talking, and writing about the New Aesthetic” (Aim2012a).While women artists and curators contributed art historical perspective, including Joanne McNeil of Rhizome.org (2012), and Mez Breeze analyzed the gendered heroics of its claim to art movement status, Rahel Aima and Madeline Ashby, respectively writer and futurist gave a basic instruction in 70'spsychoanalyticfeminist screentheory.Inherblogpost at The State, entitled 'Curation, Gender and the New Aesthetic', Aima awkwardly suggested that the attraction of the New Aesthetic might lie in the possibility to "briefly inhabit a (conventionally)feminised subjectivity?" (2012b).In herwords, 
The New Aesthetic is about being looked at by humans and by machines — by drones, surveillance cameras, people tagging you on Facebook — about beingtheobject of thegaze.It’sabout lookingthroughtheeyesof a machineandseeingthemachineturnitsbeadyLEDsonyou.It’sabout the dissolution of privacy and reproductive rights, and the monitoring, mapping, and surveillance of the (re)gendered (re)racialised body, and building our own super-pervasive panopticon.(Aima 2012) 
Ashby went further, rebooting Laura Mulvey's seminal destruction of Hollywood objects to point out that what was being celebrated and sentimentalized by the New Aesthetic were fairly normative investments in the (en)gendering of control and domination.Thisseemedlikearatherordinary,age-oldaestheticof "everyday (women’s) life", 
That spirit of performativity you have about your citizenship, now? That sense that someone’s peering over your shoulder, watching everything you do and say and think and choose? That feeling of being observed? It’s not anewfacet of lifeinthetwenty-first century.It’swhat it feelslikeforagirl. (Ashbery 2012) 
From here, more general reflections were made on the psycho-dynamics in screen power, and the lack of attention to the ontological and historical differences carried along by the New Aesthetic itself: 
The fact that it’s a conversation between artists and the forces observing themisnothing new.We’ve been throughthis before.We used to design cathedralssograndGodhadtonotice.Nowweprint thepatternof faded denimjeansonlinenpantssocleverlytheInternet hastonotice.We crochet masks so facial recognition-enabled cameras won’t notice... Someone hasalwaysbeen watching.(Ashbery 2012) 
Significantly, these perspectives suggests that the New Aesthetic not only sentimentalizes surveillance, but much more uncannily, extends or projects phallocentricscreenrelationsontotheactualityof things.Of coursecurrent feminist approaches to the cinematic gaze are more nuanced that Mulvey's radical and polemicalreduction.Spectatoridentifications,whetherin the cinema oracross multiple forms and kinds of screens are not so clean cut.It could easily be argued thoughthat the resort to her work somehow mirrors the reductive assumptions of identification in theNewAestheticitself.But furthermore,identificationislesshelpfulintheorythan attention to drives, attachments, habits, and especially, logics, when dealing with new media.The New Aesthetictakes place in a post-cinematic moment,a computational moment,aswe willargue in thisbook.We need to take media farmore seriouslyin considerationsof politicalquestions.If thenotionof thegazeissignificant,thenit emerges from how the New Aesthetic marks out its strangeness in media and asa theoryobject.Herewedrawon(not only)feminist contributionstosuggest that the New Aesthetic's projective attunement speaks not to a romance not with God or the internet, but with the bemusing inhumanity of media power. 
NET EFFECTS 
The new aesthetic episode, and the set of reactions it spawned, reveals what can happen when an open sketchbook of ideas and experiment in transparent research is conductedinourcurrent networkculture.Inapost totheCRUMBlist,HonorHarger captured a sense of the more tragic outcomes of the debate with some sober reflections.Shehighlighted,inparticular,herdismayat theextremereactionsto Bridle'sTumblr,especiallythe'sneeringinsults'of hiswork.Bycontrast,sheinsists, that thisproject wasnevera'movement',but apersonalproject.It wasnever concerned with media art practice, and judging it within those terms is at best 'pointless', at worst, 'unfair', 
That someone's research project, undertaken in the open and transparently, has gone so ballistic, so quickly, and with so little input or comment fromit'sauthor,isasignof ourtimes,Iguess.It doesn't speak well of the future of open, intuitive, long-form modes of public research, that's forsure.(Hoger2012) 
Clearly, net discourse currently unfolds with a degree of carelessness, a kind of terminalcaseof blindnessandincomprehension.Thisaloneshouldmakeustake pause. 
Indeed, we might wonder the extent to which this outpouring was provoked by and aimed at Sterling's post, an essay loaded with high praise, polemics and provocations (but forgotten criticisms).There are some significant concerns here.How can a new generation experiment and develop within a network culture characterised by such intensity, but also competing interests, investments and agendas? The new aesthetic might offeratoposoracommon,but thisspaceisrifewithconflict.Various accusations that Bridle presented a set of half-baked arguments that cannot withstandrigorousanalysisissomehowasobviousasit isirrelevant.Coherent theses or complete philosophies are not usually presented in the shape of single-serving Tumblr.But testinganideaandcontrastingit withothercontributorstoaddtoit and open it up to external input is an important aspect of network culture that should be supported.Workin process needs to be taken as such,and asChristopher'm00t' Poole might put, we need to maintain spaces where people are free to make mistakes (2010). 
Discussing the recently published book Imagery in the 21st Century (2012) in a post to the iDC list, Trebor Scholz, 
At first, I asked myself, what holds the twenty chapters in this booktogether.What doallthepuzzlepiecesaddupto?Ananalysis of contemporary imagery felt like an uncomfortably all-embracing ambition.What are we talking about when we are thinking about contemporary visuality? The advent of infographics, games, CCTV, animated gifs, art generated by algorithms, histograms, 4D visualizations, or Instagram? Constructively, the authors reflect on imagery not merely through the lens of a specific device, genre, social practice, or social function, and it becomes clear that image literacy can no longerbetheexclusivedomainof art historians.But arewereally,asthe booksuggests,amidst animagerevolution?...What,then,issosubversive ornew,aTumblrimagecollectionmight helptoanswer.(Schulz2012) 
While acknowledging the significance of the New Aesthetic Tumblr to convey a different sense of visual knowledge, Schulz expands his analysis to consider a call for new literaciesforanalysis,intepretation and criticalreflection.This is something crucial that we support, something that we want to develop throughout what follows. 
Opening up a space of discussion in the public sphere about a new way of looking at theworldisnot somethingthat happensveryoften.Whenit did,that windowof opportunity was not a result of the efforts of hundreds of researchers in the higher education sector -it happened because a group of designers in London that make witty blog posts and do keynote presentations in creative industries conferences, somehow caught the imagination of an audience.Even if the thesis was somehow confused and confusing, this amalgam of pixelated nostalgia, drones and computer vision stood for something strongly enough that people would be willing to listen. 
So while some academics will just point at the capacity of talented designers to frame a (possibly flawed) idea in a catchy way and dress it up with interesting images, other thinkers and researchers in the New Media community will confess they only have themselves to blame for their incapacity to make their work resonate out of their sphere of influence. 
It would be risky to make assumptions, but Bridle’s sudden decision to close the New Aesthetic Tumblr on May 6th this year feels like his response to the debate sparked by hisideas;onemoresignof discomfort.Andalthoughheachievedanicesymmetryby terminating the site exactly one year to the day it was first opened, a feeling of incompletenessloomsoverthewholeenterprise.Hisambiguityabout thefutureof the New Aesthetic -“The project will continue in other forms and venues" (2012b) •doesn’t offerthepromiseof acleardeliverable.Theproducts,fornow,remain unknown.

The contemporary obsession with novelty is an obsession of high capitalist consumerism: we need to own the newest tech gadget, dress ourselves in the latest fashion, enjoy the freshest foraged ingredients for the new thing in molecular dining experiences,and continuouslyand persistently come up withnew exciting ideasto market ourselvesandourjobs.AscommunicationsguruMarshallMcLuhansaidinone of his numerous probes, "At the very high speed of living, everybody needs a new career and a new job and a totally new personality every ten years" (McLuhan 2002: 114-115). 
'New' is both trendy and trending, 'new' is youthful, 'new' surprises us, 'new' is the varnish elaborately used to shine up that what is already there, what has been lying around in the bottom of the drawer collecting dust and what no one paid attention to... untilit becomesthelatest 'new'thing.Perhaps'new'istomodesof consumptionwhat 'radical'hasbeentocontemporaryart overthepast fewdecades.

The 'new' comes into art in a different way, in the sense that art makes us see things 'anew'anddefamiliarisesourperceptionof things.Inhisoriginalblogpost on'TheNew Aesthetic' of May 6th 2011 on the Really Interesting Group website Bridle intends to make us “see the technologies we have withnew wonder” (2012a).In otherwords, Bridle is employing a tested curatorial strategy of selecting images in order to have that very collection produce a different way of looking – he wants us to see with 'new' eyes,asit were.Solet ustreat Bridle'soriginalpost ascuratedexhibitionspace,a curatorial project which attempts to unearth something about contemporary visual perception and image production. 
Blog posts are rigid exhibition platforms: they are unforgivingly linear, so that the sequence of images – whether intended or not – has to be read according to a certain hierarchy.Bridle'sNewAestheticblogkicksoff withaNASAsatelliteimageof an agriculturallandscape(2012a).Weseeanabstract painterlycomposition, consisting de facto of arockylandformationwithapixelatedgreenpattern.Theorigin of this image does not seem to be of great importance, as its biography is summarised in a minimal hyperlinked caption as “Guardian gallery of agricultural landscapes from space”.What mattersthough,isthevisualimpact of thisimage.Itsnaturalroughand organic textures mix with unworldly patches of green, as if the latter were photoshopped into the image.The caption suggests that what we are looking at is real,but whetherthisimageisrealorfakeisprobablybesidesthepoint.What Bridle wantsustoseeinthisimage,it appears,isitsseeminglydigitalaesthetic.Howthis image was produced however, by means of satellite technology, is not revealed in what wesee.Bridleseemstohaveselectedtheimagebecauseitsgraphicssuggest a pixillatedversionof alandscape.Thetechnologicalpropertiesthat areforegroundedin the image are those that can be discerned on a surface level; the technologies related to its graphical iteration are not those that concern its creation. 
In addition, we only recognise this image as beautiful, and perhaps strangely alienating,becauseof itsframingandconditioningasanaestheticimage.It isthis framingof theimagethat triggeritsvisualandart historicalreferences,suchasfor exampleaerialphotographyandlandart.What isalsointerestingabout thisimageis that it 'works' by grace of its technological mediation: The image is captured from a huge distance by satellite, a perspective that is foreign to us and by corollary is capableof conjuringupanimagerythat isvisuallyandconceptuallyintriguing.If we would be walking in the landscape we would not experience the same visual impact, as we would recognise our surroundings as known and ordinary. Here Bridle has put forwardapuresurfaceimage.Itsreferent intherealisof noconsequenceforour aestheticappreciationof it.Inthat sense,thisimagecanbeperceivedasahermetic– whetherweplaceit onlineasajpgorprint it out andhangit onthewall.Itsontology remains the same, only its scale and mode of presentation might change. 
It is all the more curious then, that Bridle’s last image posted on the blog – closing the series of his exhibition, as it were -is photo documentation of British sculptor Cornelia Parker’s work Embryo Firearms (1995).Parkeris well-known forprobing and stretching thepossibilitiesof thematerialssheworkswith.Shedestroysandexplodesmatterto pushit intoanewform,orresuscitatesdiscardedmaterialsintonewlives.Herwork hasbeendescribedas'brutalbeautyorsweet carnage'(Hattenstone2010).Muchof Parker's work is ephemeral and site-specific, it is always spatially embodied and rangesfrompulverisedsculpturalparticlestogiant shotguns.Thematerialityof things 
– where it begins and where it ends – is what Parker is interested in. 
Why would Bridle choose to include Parkers’ piece consisting of a pair of cast steel Colt 45 guns in their earliest stage of production? There is no pixel fetishism or other digital-sensibilities-penetrating-physical-surroundings that characterise the other imagesin the selection.Instead,the objects are guns coming into being,halted in their development and therefore never fully functional, perfectly polished and facing each otherasif mirrored.Theyarecommoditiesthat arenot yet sociallyengaged.What is compelling here about Parker’s colts is that they capture the promise of a product, a Colt 45.But morespecifically,theworkisareferent,agun,andthephysicalobject properintoone.This,indeed,makesusseethingsanew,asthepromiseof theNew Aestheticgoesandishardlyastrategyunknowntoconceptualart.But what is interesting about the references to conceptual art work on Bridle's blog is that conceptual art, like the New Aesthetic, has paid similar heightened attention to publicity regimes, the relationship between art, image and matter as an investment in the actual experience of the work (see Alberro 2003). 
The acknowledgement of art objects as commodities and things that have perceptual, semiotic and material impact, together, is set out for example in Brian Jungen's recent conceptualart practice.Hisworkconsciouslytoyswiththecomplexityof therelation betweenrawmaterial,thepurecommodityandthecommodity-object of art.Jungen uses plastic chairs to construct whale skeletons or Nike sneakers to make tribal masks.Hispracticeisallabout what JessicaMorgancalls“misplacedusevalue” (Morgan 2006): his objects are mass-produced consumer items, but also singular art objectsthat keepareferent outsidethesphereof art.Jungen’sobjects,likeParker’s guns, are hyphenated and accumulative objects and are always-already literate in the strange sociality of things. 
In 'The fetishism of commodities and the secret thereof', Marx shows how commodities seem to capture social relations in their very essence: 
A commodity appears, a first sight, a very trivial thing, and easily understood.Itsanalysisshowsthat it is,inreality,averyqueerthing, abounding in metaphysicalsubtleties and theologicalniceties.So faras it is a value in use, there is nothing mysterious about it, whether we consider it from the point of view that by its properties it is capable of satisfying human wants, or from the point that those properties are the product of humanlabor.It isasclearasnoondaythat man,byhisindustry,changes the forms of the materials furnished by Nature, in such a way as to make themusefultohim.Theformof woodforinstance,isalteredbymakinga tableout of it.Yet,forallthat,thetablecontinuestobethat common, everydaything,wood.But,sosoonasit stepsforthasacommodity,it is changedintosomethingtranscendent.It not onlystandswithitsfeet on the ground, but, in relation to all other commodities, it stands on its head, and evolves out of its wooden brain grotesque ideas, far more wonderful than “table-turning” everwas.(2007:83) 
It is this uncanniness that art works exacerbate and that curators choose how to deal with critically (this decision not fixed in advance) quite differently to designers, especiallyindisplaydecisions.Designtendstowardsflatterdynamicsof utility,beauty and branding that seem still able to travel well once the object is turned into a representation only.Whetherthe commodification processcollapses into a flat representation online, or is halted, such as in Bridle's mood board or Parker's guns captured by it, the different suspensions of this drama accentuate the commodity statusof thething,fixedintosurface.Criticalartistsdifferentlytakeaccount of these uncannydynamicsof commodificationintheirindividualworks.Unlikethefirst imagein Bridle’s collection, the photo of the art work Embryo Firearms cannot be reduced to a flat image since the artwork actually physically exists, or "stands on the ground" in Marx'sterms(2007:83).Itsdocumentationonawebpageworksonadifferent visual andinterpretativeregisterthanthephysicalobject itself.Hereit does matter whether you are looking at a jpg file on the screen or encountering Embryo Firearms spatially, because the difference creates very different perceptions of aesthetic encounter in the viewer.Indeed there is limited to no "encounter" with Embryo Firearms upon flattening.Theconditionsof presentation(e.g.,gallery,museum,orstudio)andhow the work is contextualised, installed and framed in relation to its surroundings alters ourreadingandexperienceof thework.Tostageit inspaceistotakeintoaccount the embodied and perceptual experience of its imaging and how it impresses on the body as a proximate material-semiotic thing. 
In contrast to the first image in Bridle’s collection, which seems to be able to exist solely on the webpage because it is already a transcendental commodity, Embryo Firearms as documentation therefore feels like it is floating in space, excised from a larger picture, decontextualized, and even bulky in comparison with the other images, which radiate a lightness of form, even those that depict images of fighter planes. Embryo Firearms can never inhabit that lightness because it identifies itself prima facie as a an object installed in space and time and human-scaled relation, whilst the satellite image does not.Even thoughaesthetically we can read the documentation of Embryo Firearms as an image of art, it lacks the objectness that waspreciselytheinquiryof thework.Sowhywasit takenupinthecollection,andwhy does it even close the series? Well, because for the New Aesthetic, the idea is that softwarized material strives flatly in the direction of transcendental commodity status, even when it doesn't get there.On the “mood-board for unknown products” (Bridle 2012a) Parker’s guns are unable to be truly staged as queer vascillations of metaphysical and theological, natural and artificial, materials and labour. 
6. COLLECT, REMIX, CONTRIBUTE -> CURATE? 
Remixing and collaging elements found on the Web has been a part of net art since its inception in the 1990s.Early works suchas MTAA's Ten Digital Readymades (2000), created by entering the term 'ready made' into a search engine and archiving those search results, exemplified the sense that material on the web offers rich fodder for artists to develop work, with or without heavy subsequent alteration by artists (Kasprzak 2009).A few yearslater,comparable collections -or'flea marketsof images' (Ramocki 2008) -became widely available on the web due to the growth of uploaded content and sharing media online, as well as the ongoing evolution of search engines.Thosefactors,coupledwithsimplewebsitedevelopment becomingan increasingly rapid and easy process, has produced conditions for creative expression that ranges from 'surf clubs', group blogs where artists share the fruit of their Web surfing and fragments of their art practices, to image collecting on the pinboard-style photosharingplatformPinterest.What isinterestingabout Ten Digital Readymades, however, and the link it sets up between Duchamp and process, is how computation actually serves to reinvigorate our understanding of the radical aspects of the readymade concept. 
In an essay by Matthew Fuller, reviewing net art practices that used appropriation and remixing before the advent of social web-phenomena such as surf clubs, Tumblr, and Pinterest, he states: 
Firstly, each piece of work is not especially apart from the other works by theartist orgroupsthat producedit -it ispart of apractice.Secondly,each work is assembled out of parts that belong to a collectively available resource.Sothisagain,issomethingset asidefromthestandardissueart modes,uniquevisions,talentedindividualsandalltherest of it.It isthe powerto connect.(Fuller2001) 
Putting Fuller's quote into context, he seems to support the idea that assembling something out of parts that 'belong to a collectively available resource' provides a more or less direct lineage from the earliest Dadaists collage art, to net art, to surf clubs,toTumblr,andtoPinterest.Fuller'sassertionisthat thiskindof onlinebricolage brings us out of 'standard issue art modes' confronts the perennial battle between low and high culture, i.e., between the talented artists and the hopeless amateurs, since anyone can access the collective resource online, appropriate things, remix them and start collections.The establishment side is represented in Guardian blogger Stephen Moss's assertions that "the great majority of popular culture in the UK is worthless, moronic, meretricious, self-serving, anti-democratic, sclerotic garbage: it's the enemy of thought and change: it should be ignored, marginalised, trashed" (2007). Of course, we would not deny malaise just to creative industrial pop, but we need to acknowledge, regardless, that the lines between the production of professional cultural workers (and commentators) and creative work produced in more economized modes have been more complex and blurred for some time. 
We want to emphasize that curating and collecting are not the same, though some might arguefromthat premise.Onecancollect stamps,miniaturetrains,andart,but curating implies a public gesture and a subject position that frames the collection and intendsto produce connections between the collected items.In otherwords,curation is interested in producing meanings that push the collection to be more than the sum of itsparts.It callsforapositioning–bethat aesthetic,thematic,technological, politicalorotherwise.Onecouldarguethenthat collectivespaceslikeTumblrand Pinterest are curated spaces because they are public and – to a certain extent – themed.However,do these image collections in theiropenness and volume tellus more about the images we are viewing, or are they just producing more of the same? Curating, any curator will grudgingly admit, is seldom democratic, it is based on selection,andselectionisneverinclusivebydefault.Thephenomenonof online collectionasit relatestocuratingisdescribedat lengthin For What and For Whom?, 
The larger role of the curator encompasses the creation of links to other creative dialogues, writing and contextualising work, developing the physical (or virtual) exhibition sequencing and flow, and perhaps most important of all, nurturing a relationship with the practitioners who make the work and understanding the narrative inherent in their career trajectory. (Or, in the case of those who work with historical collections, having a scholarly background on the movements/time periods/artists represented inthesecollections).What canandwillbelost inthereductionof theterm curator to mean one who clicks on a thumbs-up or thumbs-down icon is that senseof forwhat andforwhom.(Kasprzak2008) 
Therehavebeenattemptsat openonlinecurating.Forexample,theopensource software application KURATORby programmerGrzesiek Sedekand curatorJoasia Krysa (2004), which merges a platform for source code (as art), with an open and collaborative curatorial platform: 
Designed as free software that can be further modified by users, kurator follows the structures and protocols of conventional curating and implements a series of algorithmic processes that partly automates these procedures.It translatescuratorialprotocolsintomodularsoftware protocols, breaking down the curatorial process into a series of commands orrules.The software opens up the curatorialprocess to the public by offering a system that is open to user input — in terms of submitting examples of source code, arranging displays, commenting on these, adding functionality and modifications to the software itself.(KURATOR 2012) 
Users can add code to the repository, tag it, browse other contributor’s comments andsubmissions.Inthat respect itsdynamicsresemblemorethat of asocial networkingspaceoradatabasethanacuratorialspace.MarinaVishmidt commentsin her rhizome post on Kurator that it, 
Posits ‘software curating’ as a way to distribute curatorial process over networks of people, including artists and others, and finally outwards from thespecialdomainof anindividual.It furthercombatsthereificationof taste by partially automating many of the traditional metiers that distinguishthecurator-selectivitybeingone.(Vishmidt 2005) 
We must ask, though, can the attribution of meaning and criticality be automated? 
Can this job be done at all by a machine? And can open source models just be copy-pasted and applied to curatorial practices? Where do we locate its criticality if any? These are questions that must be considered when we investigate online image collectingandmovingcuratorialtechniquestotheonlinerealm.Theywillnot answer themselves,norgo awayanytime soon.We should encourage further experimentation, artistic research and theorization of these topics. 
7. ERROR 404: NO AESTHETIC FOUND 

At the core of new media art is the question of how culture is embracing digital technology.Representing digitalartefactsand online behavioursin the physicalworld is a recognized artistic strategy among new media artists to address this question (for anexample,Bartholl2012).Althoughmanynewmediaartworksarepart of or comment on the “eruption of the digital into the physical” (Sterling 2012) that the New Aesthetic speaks to, we have been challenged to think why many of them would be out of place posted on the New Aesthetic Tumblr or grouped as part of that meme. 
THE REPRESENTATION PROBLEM 
The New Aesthetic meme lives online (Bridle 2012a, 2012b), which by default means that any physical thing or event it embraces is by definition a digital representation of that thingorevent.Thisisproblematicforanartworkthat isconceptuallygroundedin the fact that it is physical, taking place in three dimensionalspace and time.This includesmanynewmediaartworksthat formallyfallundertheNewAesthetic.Take Aram Bartholl's artwork Maps (2006-2010) for example, posted on the New Aesthetic Tumblr on June 2, 2011. In Maps Bartholl places actual-size Google balloons in public spaces to investigate the aesthetic of "the red map marker of the location based searchengineGoogleMaps"(Bartholl2006).Clearly,it isthesheeroverwhelming impact of a larger-than-human-sized Google Maps balloon that communicates the awkward relative measurements of digital artefacts that we seem to accept without questioninthedigitalrealm.Thisawkwardnessonlyreallybecomesapparent however when one physicallyencounterssuchan 'out-of-proportion'Google balloon.By documenting and posting such an encounter on a Tumblr, the Google Maps balloon is re-introduced into the digital realm in which its proportions are commonly accepted, which consequently radically decreases the artwork's communicative power. 
Even better examples of this 'representation problem' for new media artworks in the light of theNewAestheticexist outsideof theNewAestheticsTumblr.TakeAram Bartholl's Dead Drops (2010-2012) project for instance, "an anonymous, offline, peer to peerfile-sharing network in public space" (Bartholl2010).The file-sharing network existsof USBflashdrives'embeddedintowalls,buildingsandcurbsaccessibleto anybody in public space' and on which everyone is invited to drop or find files (ibid.). The Dead Drops concept canundeniablybecommunicatedthroughphotoorvideo documentation,but theartworkitself cannot.Theartworkconsistsof physically standing outside in the street with ones laptop pushed against a wall mounting the USB drive while receiving suspicious looks of passers-by as one drops files or picks themup.It isthisembodiedexperienceimposedbythematerialityof adeaddropthat makes a user think 'Is this legal?', 'Do I owe somebody copyright?', or 'Are the lyrics to this song perhaps too explicit?' In other words, it's the fact that Dead Drops materializesfilesharinginourdailyurbanenvironment that confrontsuswiththe ethics of online file sharing, which moreover happens anonymously and users consequently feel less accountable for their actions. 
Similarly, performative projects that (by definition) belong to the realm of the New Aesthetic suffer this 'representation problem'. Topshot Helmet (2006/2007) by Julius von Bismarck for instance, recreates the bird's eye (or 'topshot') perspective that is common in the digital realm, for instance in video games or online navigation applicationssuchasGoogleMaps.It recreatesthisperspectivebymeansof ahead-mounted display that depicts live video from a camera floating above the user's head pointingdownward.Theartworkcommentsontheunnaturalperspectivethat this bird's eye view is to humans -it's even hard to navigate an empty room with the Topshot Helmet on.Moreimportant,it conveysthisreflectiononthebird'seye perspective common in the digital realm through the physical experience of this perspective. Topshot Helmet, the artwork, is the embodied experience of the 'topshot'. Any form of online documentation of the artwork is mere representation of the actual work; something that might convey the idea behind the artwork but not do justice to the artwork itself. 
For many posts on the New Aesthetic Tumblr, the fact that Tumblr only allows for representationsof projectsinthephysicalworldisnot at allproblematic.Aglitch design is a glitch design when captured in the photograph of a billboard or flyer. Similarly, a military vehicle with pixel-like camouflage does not transform its meaning so muchin the documentation of the vehicle; it is already a surface print afterall.Many artworks that represent digital artefacts and behaviours in the offline world (and hence thus by definition belong to the 'New Aesthetic'), however do reference strongly differentiated experienced in the physicalworld.Forthisreason,artworks suchas Dead Drops and Topshot Helmet sit uncomfortably under the New Aesthetic meme. The meme lives online, while these artworks live in the world, are conceptually grounded in their materiality, and convey their concepts and material-semiotic negotiations through embodied experiences. 
BEYOND THE PIXEL SCULPTURE 
Many of the posts on the New Aesthetic Tumblr are relatively straightforward physical renditionsof adigitalaesthetic.Takethemanypixelsculpturesforexamplethat feature on the New Aesthetic Tumblr and those that appear in the lectures that followedit.Theyseemtosaynot muchmorethansomethingintheveinof "Welook perfectly normal on a computer screen, so what are you looking at?!" Besides perhaps provoking awareness regarding the low resolution of the digital realm in comparison to the world offline, these sculptures do not really affect our view on pixels, and it's safe to say that pixel sculptures do not influence our behaviour when we engage with pixels.Many artworks that by definition would qualify as belonging to the New Aesthetichoweverdomuchmorethanthat.Wemight askwhyit isexactlythose works, that aim to affect our views and influence our behaviour, that seem to be missing in the New Aestheticdiscourse.Take Domestic Tension (2007) by Wafaa Bilal for instance, a perfect exemplar of a 'native product of modern network culture' (Sterling 2012), but never discussed in the light of the New Aesthetic. 
In DOMESTIC TENSION, viewers can log onto the internet to contact or "shoot" 
Bilalwithpaintballguns.Bilal'sobjectiveistoraiseawarenessof virtualwarand

(Bilal 2007) 
Just as pixel sculptures do, Domestic Tension takes a digital phenomenon of affective experience and networked mediation into the physical: the opportunity to shoot an (often anonymous) person that could be on the other side of the world; a principleat theheart of anyonlinefirst-personshootergame.Would Domestic Tension however sit comfortably next to a pixel sculpture in the New Aesthetic conceptual container? Arguably it wouldn’t. Domestic Tension is muchmore than a physical rendition of a digital aesthetic; it has a politics of affective experience and embodied encounter that aims to affect political sensibilities and influence behaviour. Pixelsculptures ratherlacksuchaims.This fundamentaldifference between a politically engaged new media artwork and a pixel sculpture seems marked and symptomatic for the New Aesthetic; the New Aesthetic claims a status as an emergent aesthetic, but does not really aspire to any sort of active or emergent impact.Whileit makesclaimsabout therealityof thepresent,it doesnot wishto politically affect views or induce behavioural changes in that reality, like art commonly does.It merely documents and collects. 
How can an aesthetic that is concerned with"how culture is embracing the tools of today" (McNeil 2012) be this far removed from the material situations in which these tools operate and seemingly steer clear of their political implications? The so-called New Aesthetic's elision of embodied experiences and of digitality beyond surface, is an elision of position taking through asethetics and of art's investment in behavioural changes.It'sexemplarswouldbearastrikingresemblancetocontemporaryart using new media technology if it's concept were actually politicized (see Tribe and Jana 2006).But it doesn't seemdesignedtodothat.Perhapsthisiswhyit featuresso many weak experiments with new media art's toolset? Could the New Aesthetic simply be a poor attempt at curating new media art online? If so, its style is far from new and merely borrows from evolutions and throughout the history of new media art, evolutions which have been widely discussed for some years (see, e.g., Manovich 2001; Fuller 2005; Munster 2006; Bosma 2011; Brouwer, Mulder and Spuybroek 2012).IntroducingaNewAestheticthat speakstothe“eruptionof thedigitalintothe physical” (Sterling 2012), but that does not account for embodied experiences, steers awayfromthiseruption'scontextualdimensionsandpoliticalimplications.It islike buyingadomainname,but not knowinghowtobuildawebsite.Sometimeswhenone receives a 404 error, it's not worth taking a screenshot of it and posting on a Tumblr like Screenshots of Despair.Without some analysis or comprehension of these material and technical process of mediation, there is no aesthetic there.

THE NEW AESTHETIC AS REPRESENTATION 

This chapter will look at the common conception of the new aesthetic as a form of mere representation, and particularly how, so far, the New Aesthetic has been presentedasscreenicimages.It willpoint totheimportanceof themediumin understanding both the new aesthetic as collected on Tumblr as well as the wider questionof howit isunderstoodthroughthismediation.Weconstantlyrequire attentiveness with such a surface reading, as it entails a kind of flattening of the digital.A flattening whichmay,ormay not,have a presumed indexicality,suchastime, placeandsubject.Wemight alsowant tothinkabout themetadataimplicationsfora digitally constructed indexicality provided by geolocation, technical specs, and so forth embeddedintheimage.Wecanalsonot onlystayat thelevelof thescreen,thereby avoiding and/orperpetuating screen essentialism.Furthermore,we have to wrestle with questions regarding the computational while still having a tendency to lean on poor (representational) tools to do so. 
It is interesting to note that a feature/bug of computational systems is sometimes thought to be due to the immaturity of the disciplines and methods, but after 40 years of writing code/software we still suffer from the same problems – namely its complexityandourlackof metaphoricallanguagetodescribeit.Whetherinscribed within a model of procedual, functional or object-oriented structure, code is usually biggerthan a single human being can understand.Thus,in a running system,and in escaping our comprehension, it inevitably has aporia and liminal areas that mean we cannot trulypredict,controlorevenunderstanditsoperation.Whilst herewehaven't space to reflect on the radical potentialities this unpredictability and risk that this 'glitch ontology' opens in control societies, it is nonetheless suggestive for political and artistic practice. 
The New Aesthetic, then, can be understood as a comportment towards "seeing" computation, responding to it, or merely being correctly attuned to it (in a subsequent chapterthisisexploredduetoitspotentialforthepassificationof theuser).Wemight therefore ask what are that the kinds of 'things' that show up as equipment, goals, and identities in this new aestheticand how theyare specific to computationality.As Heidegger argues, 
So it happens that we, lost as we usually are in the activities of observing and 
establishing, believe we “see” many things and yet do not see what really is. 
(Heidegger 1995: 60) 
Temptations towards showing the images of the new aesthetic as somehow unmediated, particularly in relation to machine, or computer produced images, fetishizesthe"thing"whilst alsoobscuringitsmediation.TheNewAesthetic,inother words, brings these patterns to the surface, and in doing so articulates a movement towards uncovering the "unseen", the little understood logic of computational society andtheanxietiesthat thisintroduces.Nonetheless,weshould,of course,bealert to the aporias that it thereby introduces. 
Without an attentiveness to the layers of software beneath this surface interface we are in danger of further 'screen essentialism'. In terms of the computational as instantiated within computational devices (or code objects), one of the key aspects is that the surface can remain relatively stable whilst the machinery layer(s) can undergo freneticanddisorientingamountsof change(Berry2012c).Thisfranticdisorientation at themachinerylayeristhereforeinsulatedfromtheuser,whoisprovidedwitha surface which can be familiar, skeuomorphic (from the Greek, skeuos -vessel or tool, morphe -shape), representational, metonymic, figurative or extremely simplistic and domestic.It isimportant tonotethat thesurface/interfaceneednot bevisual,indeed it may be presented as an application programming interface (API) which hides the underlying machinery behind this relatively benign interface. 
As discussed in the introduction, the scope and boundary points of the New Aesthetic arecurrentlybeingdrawn,redrawnandcontested.Thisisgreat:it lives,it isbeing trackedandexperimentedwith,reworkedandsoon.But criticalattentionneedstobe paid especially to the New Aesthetic's formal investments in the non-human dimension of the computational, both in terms of a worrying (rather than methodological) decentring of the human, but also its related problem of granting anthropomorphized agency to code. 
Indeed, this raises questions about what we might call the "thinginess" of the new aestheticobject moregenerally.Toalargeextent this"thinginess"orperhapsthe difficulty in engaging with it has been obscured due to an over-reliance on images to represent itssetsof newaesthetic"things"that purport tobeintheworld.Thismere pointing to materiality (even screenic images are material in an important sense) and assumes transparent means of communication facilitated by computational commmunicationalsystems.That is,thereappearstobeatheoryof communication inbuilt intothenewaestheticasshowninitspopularregisters.Weneedtotake account of this. 
THE REPRESENTATION PRACTICES OF THE NEW AESTHETIC 
The new aesthetic is deeply influenced by and reliant on patterns and abductive reasoning(Berry2012a).Thisisacommonthreadthat linksthelistsof objectsthat seem to have nothing more in common than a difficulty to reconcile a tenuous digitality, or a retro attachment towards older forms of digital rendering and reproduction.In actuality it is no surprise that we see a return of 8-bit retro – it could perhaps be described as the abductive aesthetic par excellence, inasmuch as it enables an instant recognition of, and indeed serves as an important representation for, the digital, especially as the digital becomes high-definition and less 'digital' by the day(seeJean2010).Differently,thisisa'down-sampled'representationof akindof digital past, or perhaps digital passing, given that the kinds of digital glitches, modes, and forms that are chosen are very much historically located – especially considering that we are moving into a high-definition world of retina displays and high-pixel density experience (for an example, see Huff 2012). 
As computation, and by definition its carriers, code and software, increasingly withdraw into the background of our experience, we have increasingly seen this foregrounding of representations of, and for, the digital/computational across art and design.Insomeways,8-bit imagesarereassuringandstillcomprehensibleas different fromandstandinginoppositiontotheeverydayworldpeopleinhabit.Inother ways, however, the glitchy, retro 8-bit esque look that we see in pixelated works are actually distant from the capabilities of contemporary machines and their 8-bit blocky ontologies provide only limited guidance on the way in which software now organises andformatstheourshared,andsharable,world(Berry2011).Soironically,just as digital technologies and software mediate our experience and engagement with the world, often invisibly, so the 'digital' and 'software' is itself mediated and made visible through the representational forms of pixelation and glitch. 
As notions of abduction and related aesthetic styles in art and design become more prevalent it will be interesting to see more exemplars of this form emerge and see how wedealwiththem.Whilst todaywetendtothinkof the8-bit pixelation,satellite photos, CCTV images, and the like, it is probable that alternative, more computational forms willprobaby take over.Perhaps skeuomorphic images willbecome increasingly common? Or indeed skeuomorphic representations of older 8-bit technologies (for example enabled by MAMEand otheremulators)(see MAME2012).Conceivably,this leads to a form of cognitive dissonance, perpetuating drives to look for pattern aestheticseverywhere.Apophenia,the tendency to see meaningfulpatterns or connections in random or meaningless data (called a type 1 error in statistics) is definitelyplayingout intheNewAestheticinthisregard.Wemight furtherexpect that people are also seeking digital or abductive explanations for arts of other moments, for visual or even non-visual experiences which may not be digital or produced through computational means at all, a digital pareidolia. 
Pareidolia involves seeing importance in vague and random phenomenon, for example afaceinarandomcollectionof dotsonpaper.Theterm'digitalpareidolia'wecointo gesture towards this tendency in the New Aesthetic to see digital causes for things that happenineverydaylife.Indeed,underfutureregimesof computationalityit might beconsideredstrangertobelievethat thingsmight havenon-digitalcauses.Thus apophenia would be the norm in a highly digital computational society, perhaps even a significant benefit to one's life chances and well-being if finding patterns becomes increasinglylucrative.Herewemight considerthegrowthof computationalhigh•frequency trading and financial systems that are trained and programmed to identify patterns very quickly. 
Software is not only necessary for representation; it is also endemic of 
transformations in modes of “governing” that make governing both more personal 
andimpersonal,that enablebothempowerment andsurveillance,andindeed 
makeit difficult todistinguishbetweenthetwo.(Chun2011:58) 
When we speak of seeing the grain of computation, or perhaps its 'seams', what do we mean by this and what is being articulated in particular discourses around the representation of the new aesthetic? Here we might note that seeing the grain of computation, is a merely representational model of understanding a media form, and although useful in one dimension is unable to capture a range of specific medial aspects and issues that are very important, and to which we now turn. 
9. WHAT ARE THE CONDITIONS OF POSSIBILITY FOR THE NEW AESTHETIC? 
We want to raise the question about the conditions of possibility for the new aesthetic, that is, for the possibility of surfacing the digital through representational andmediationalforms.Firstly,let'slookat thenotionof aformof foundational ontology that informs everyday life and thinking through a notion of computationality. Secondly, we will examine the question of technology, understood here as the specificity of computational technology, and its diffusion as networked, mobile, digital technologies.Creativepracticesareassumedforthesakeof thischaptertobeontic dramas that take place always already within very specific informational, network and politicalorganizations.Whetherfineart,non-profit orcreativeindustrial,suchontic activitydisplayshugelyvariabledegreesof awarenessof theseconditions.If,aswe have argued, the New Aesthetic offered up a way to think about and inhabit a present regime of computationality without explicitly and reflexively taking account of what it is that we attend to, then let us consider the background nature of this computational way-of-being. 
COMPUTATIONALITY 
In order to move beyond the vagaries of the ‘technological sublime’, we should begin the theoretical and empirical projects that can create ‘cognitive maps’ (Jameson 1991).First we should draw attention to basic categories in what we might call informational,orcomputationalsocieties.This is helpfulin enabling usto draw the contours of what is called 'computationality', and in articulating the relationship of this the new aesthetic.Asthe digitalincreasingly structuresthe contemporaryworld, curiously, it also withdraws; it becomes harder and harder for us to focus upon, as it becomesembedded,hidden,off-shored,ormerelyforgottenabout.Part of the challenge for citizens of a regime of computation is to bring the digital (code/software) backintovisibilityforexploration,researchandculturalcritique.Of coursereflexive media art work, artistic and curatorial, has demonstrated significant and active investments in this. 
Computationality is a central, effective, dominant system of meanings and values that are abstract but also organizing and lived.To take account of what computationality is to the New Aesthetic cannot be understood at the level of mere opinionormeremanipulation.It isrelatedtoawholeoperativebodyof computational practices and expectations, for example how we assign energy towards particular projects and how we ordinarily understand the 'nature' of humans and the world.The meanings and values that it sets up are experienced as practices which are reciprocally confirming, repeated and predictable, at the same time as being used to describe and understand the world itself.It is possible that software itself is the explanatory form of explanation itself (see Chun 2011). 
When the New Aesthetic, alongside similar media art practices, contributes to a sense of reality, touches a growing sense or suspicion towards the digital, or gives a sense of the limits or even the absolute, this is also because experienced reality beyond everyday life is too difficult for most members of a society to move or understand. What we are dealing with is a heuristic pattern for everyday life – the parameterization of ourbeing-in-the-world.Anexampleof parameterizationasakindof default (digital) grammar of everyday life would be say, that mediated through the 140 characters in Twitter or other social media. 
Computation in this sense can be considered as an ontotheology.A specific historical epoch defined by a certain set of computational knowledges, practices, methods and categories.Related to this is a phenomenologicalexperience of frantic disorientation causedby,orthrought tobecontributingtolivedexperience–whichisnot incidentally an important marker of the specificity of the New Aesthetic that foregrounds or even renders as normal the loss of control, loss of human importance or the erasure of difference between human and non-human.Therefore new aesthetic registrations of the computational regime involve, in an important sense, an abductive aesthetic built on patterning and first order logics, in which computational patterns and pattern recognition become a means of cultural expression. 
Patterns are deeply imbricated with computerized recognition, repeated codes, artifacts and structural elements that enable something to be recognised as a type of thing(seeHarvey2011,2012foravisualisationof facialpatternrecognition).Thisis not just visual,of course.Patternsmayberecognisedindatasets,textualarchives, data points, distributions, non-visual sensors, physical movement or gestures, haptic forces,andsoon.Indeed,thispointstotheimportanceof informationvisualisationas part of an abduction aesthetic in order to 'visualise' the patterns that are hidden in sets of data. 
Thus, computationality (as an ontotheology) instantiates a new ontological ‘epoch’ as anewhistoricalconstellationof intelligibility.Code/softwareistheparadigmaticcase of computationality, and presents us with a computational 'objects' which are located at allmajorjuncturesof modernsociety.Toviewit asanontotheologyenablesusto understand the present situation and its collections, networks, or assemblage of 'coded objects' or 'code objects'. 
One of the things that the New Aesthetic strongly expresses (which indeed is not that newinfineart orpopculture)istheconcept of a'glitchontology'.Toseethe'eruption of the digital into the physical' (which we understand as 'iruption') everywhere, is to acknowledge glitchasan ontologicalcondition.Heideggerhas veryinterestingly conceptualised the way in which everyday objects come to presence and withdraw from our attention over time, depending on the way in which they are used, which he describes as Vorhandenheit (or present-at-hand) and Zuhandenheit (or ready-to•hand).ThecommonexampleHeideggerusesisthat of ahammer,whichobservedina detached manner appears as 'present-at-hand', as an object decontextualised before us.Incontrast,whenusedbythecarpenterit becomes'ready-to-hand',that ispart of the activity, or making, of the carpenter, no longer noticed as a discrete object. 
In contrast to the more subtle shifts in the vision/use of the hammer, computational devices appear to oscillate rapidly between Vorhandenheit/ Zuhandenheit (present•at-hand/ready-to-hand)– this is a glitchontology.Perhapseven more accurately, computational things are constantly becoming ready-to-hand/unready-to-hand in quick alternation.Byquickthis can mean happening in microseconds,milliseconds,or seconds,repeatedlyinquicksuccession.Theupsettingof seamlessuserexperience throughongoingrisksof,andexposureto,glitch,isanongoingdevelopment issue within human-computer design, which sees it as a pressing concern to be ‘fixed’ or madeinvisibleorseamlesstotheuser(WinogradandFlores1987).Wewant to emphasize that this is a concept of 'glitch' that is specific to computation, as opposed to other technical forms (Berry 2011). 
Once glitch creates the conspicuousness that breaks the everyday experience of things, and more importantly breaks the flow of things being comfortably at hand, this is a form that Heidegger called Unreadyness-to-hand (Unzuhandenheit). Heidegger defines three forms of unreadyness-to-hand: Obtrusiveness (Aufdringlichkeit), Obstinacy (Aufsässigkeit), and Conspicuousness (Auffälligkeit), where the first two are non-functioning equipment and the latter is equipment that is not functioning at itsbest (seeHeidegger1978,fn1).Importantlyhere,if equipment breaksyouhaveto think about it. 
Conspicuousness, or conspicuous computation is not a sign of completely broken equipment.Conspicuousness only ‘presents the available equipment as in a certain unavailableness’ (Heidegger 1978: 102–3), so that as Dreyfus (2001: 71) explains, we are momentarily startled, and then shift to a new way of coping, but which, if help is given quickly or the situation is resolved, then ‘transparent circumspective behaviour can be so quickly and easily restored that no new stance on the part of Dasein is required’(Dreyfus2001:72).AsHeideggerputsit,it requires‘amoreprecisekindof circumspection, such as “inspecting”, checking up on what has been attained, [etc.]’ (Dreyfus 2001: 70). 
In other words computation, due to its glitch ontology, continually forces a contextual slowing-down at the level of the mode of being of the user, thus the continuity of flow or practice is interrupted by minute pauses and breaks (which may beyond conscious perception,assuch).Thisisnot tosaythat analoguetechnologiesdonot breakdown, the difference is the conspicuousness of digital technologies in their everyday working, in contrast to the obstinacy or obtrusiveness of analogue technologies, which tend to workornot.Thereisalsoadiscretegranularityof theconspicuousnessof digital technologies, which can be measured technically as seconds, milliseconds, or even microseconds.Allof theseaspectsof glitchontologyraiseinterestingquestionsabout our experiences of computational systems. 
The New Aesthetic is interesting in this context because of its implicit investment in representation, showing the surface of the extent to which digital media has permeatedoureverydaylives.InDeleuziantermswemight thinkof twostratahere: the first, computationality as the plane of content/materiality; and creative practices including the New Aesthetic as the plane of expression (Deleuze and Guattari 1987: 43).Importantly,and as Deleuze and Guattarimake explicit,sucha formulation is useful because each plane does not need to have a direct connection, logic, or resemblancetotheother.Indeed,therepresentationalplane,asit were,canbeonly loosely coupled to the other. 
Computation, understood within the context of computationality, pervades our everydaylife.It thereforebecomesoneparticularlimit (thereareothersof course)of our possibilities for reason, experience and desire within this historical paradigm of knowledge,orepisteme(seeBerry2012c).Onecanthinkof creativepracticesas being bounded extricably with the computational and the foundation for developing a cognitivemap(Jameson2006:516).Thefact that abductionaestheticsare networked, sharable, modular, 'digital', and located both in the digital and analogue worlds is appropriate, because they follow the colonisation of the lifeworld by the technics of computationality. 
David Hockney writing about his Fresh Flowers (Grant 2010) links his artistic work to the medial affordances of the computational device, in this case an iPad, stating 'when using his iPhone or iPad to draw, the features of the devices tend to shape his choice of subject...The fact that it's illuminated makes you choose luminous subjects' (Freeman 2012).Parisiand Portanova furtherargue foran algorithmic aesthetic with their notion of 'soft thought': 
the aesthetic of soft thought precisely implies that digital algorithms are autonomous, conceptual modes of thinking, a thinking that is always already a mode of feeling ordered in binary codes, and is not to be confused with sensing or perceiving.Numericalprocessing is always a feeling,a simultaneouslyphysicaland conceptual mode of feeling data, physical in the actual operations of the hardware-software machine, conceptual in the grasp of numbers as virtualities or potentials (Parisi and Portanova 2012). 
Other researchers (Beaulieu et al 2012) have referred to 'Network Realism’ to draw attentiontosomeof thesevisualpractices.Manyof theartworksinthisbookcanbe seentofallunderthiscategoryof work.Suchworksdisplaysimilarinvestmentsin producing visual, affective and object-based articulations of digitality and the network. 
The Tumblr blog that presents the New Aesthetic to us as a stream of data – again, significant in this reading of computationality (see also Kittler 2009) -collects digital and pseudo-digital objects through a computational frame, and is only made possible throughnewformsof computationalcurationtools,suchasTumblrandPinterest (2012).TheNewAestheticthusgivesadescriptionandawayof representingand mediating the world in and through the digital, that is understandable as an infinite archive (orcollection).Secondly,alongside many othercreative practicesincluding art practices that we have pointed to in this book, The New Aesthetic alternately highlights the fact that something digital is a happening in culture – something which we have only barely been conscious of – and also that culture is happening to the digital.Togethertheseaspectsontological,technical,andof coursematerial, contribute to what we might call the condition of possibility for emerging aesthetic practices invested in the present, invested as these are in irupting the 'digital' into the 'real'. 
More surface-level investments such as those captured in the New Aesthetic we might say remain focussed on the aesthetic in the first instance (rather than the ontological) and in this way perpetuate the obfuscation of the sociological and political realityof computationalconditions.Thisisausefulpoint of distinctionforconsidering the difference between aesthetic forms instantiated within the computational condition.Thepoint wewant tomakeisthat thecollectionsthat BridleandSterlingin particular are identifying are in fact more symptomatic than exemplary of a computational paradigm in creative work, of whatever kind. Some of us think this is a fairly obvious point to make, but it nevertheless needs this degree of explanation. Surface digitality elides computational realities that inform aesthetic feeling, while holding unclear or haphazard investments in such hidden or lower level realities. 
THE NEW AESTHETIC AS MEDIATION 
Let's explore the notion of mediation within the contours of the New Aesthetic, in particular the computational contribution or facilitation of certain way of working, looking,anddistributing.Whilst weareawareof thelimitationsthat thestructureof this book enforces on our discussion of mediation, and especially the difficulties of explicating the complexities of computational media, it is clear that emerging creative practices are problematising,in some sense,this medialdimension.Indeed,medial change is linked to epistemic change – and here of course, we are referring to a software condition. 
Software presents a translucent interface relative to a common 'world' and so enablesengagement witha'world',thisweoftencallitsinterface.It istempting,when trying to understand software/code to provide analysis at the level of this surface. However, software also possesses an opaque machinery that mediates engagement that isnot experienceddirectlynorthroughsocialmediations.Without an attentiveness to the layers of software beneath this surface interface we are in dangerof 'screenessentialism'.Intermsof thisanalyticapproach,oneof thekey aspects is that the surface can remain relatively stable whilst the machinery layer(s) canundergofreneticanddisorientingamountsof change(Fuller2003).Thisfrantic disorientation at the machinery layer is therefore insulated from the user, who is provided with a surface which can be familiar, skeuomorphic (from the Greek, skeuos •vessel or tool, morphe -shape), representational, metonymic, figurative or extremely simplisticanddomestic.It isimportant tonotethat thesurface/interfaceneednot be visual, indeed it may be presented as an application programming interface (API) whichhides the underlying machinerybehind thisrelatively benign interface.Here,are useful links to many of the formulations around a notion of the New Aesthetic. 
Indeed, we argue that the New Aesthetic is interesting as a kind of pointing or gesturing towards mediation by digital processes, in some instances connecting to claims whereby it renders human input or control unnecessary – similar to claims about anon-humanturn.Thisistheveryact of automaticcomputationoraformof idealized artificialintelligenceisinsomesensesatechnicalimaginarythat runsthroughthe Bridle/Sterling formulation.Mediation itself can be understood within a frame of understanding that implies the transfer between two points – often linked to notions of information theory.Guillory argues, 
the enabling condition of mediation is the interposition of distance (spatial, 
temporal, or even notional) between the terminal poles of the communication 
process (these can be persons but also now machines, even persons and 
machines). (Guillory 2010: 357) 
The software that is now widely used is part of a wider constellation of software ecologies made possible by a plethora of computational devices that facilitate the colonisationof codeintothelifeworld(seeBerry2012d).Inotherwords,software enablesaccesstocertainformsof mediatedengagement withtheworld.Thisis achieved via the translucent surface interface and enables a machinery to be 
engaged which computationally interoperates with the world. 

AVAILABLE COMMODITIES 

In this vein we want to explore the notion of availability in relation to this idea of surface.It ishelpfulheretothinkof thewaythat computationalityhasaffordances that contribute to the construction and distribution of a range of commodities.We think of computationality as the very definition of the framework of possibility for social and political life today, that is, again using computationality as an ontotheology (seepreviouschapter).Herewethinkof acommodityasbeingavailablewhenit can beusedasamereend,withthemeansveiledandbackgrounded.Thisisnot onlyin technical devices, of course, and also includes the social labour and material required toproduceadeviceassuch.But intheageof computationalitywethinkit is interesting to explore how the surface effects of a certain form of computational machinery create the conditions both for the black boxing of technology as such, but alsoforthinkingabout thepossibilityof politicalandsocialactionagainst it.Iwillcall thistheparadigmof availability.Uponthissurfacewemight readandwritewhatever we choose, as we are also offered a surface to which we might read the inscrutable however we might wish. 
What is striking about the paradigm of availability made possible by computationality, is that it radically re-presents the mechanisms and structures of everyday life, themselves reconstructed within the ontology afforded bycomputationality.This moment of re-presentation is an offering of availability, understood as infinite play and exploitability (interactivity) of a specific commodity form which we might call the computationaldevice.Herewethinkof thecomputationaldevicebothintermsof its materialmanifestationsbut alsoasadiagramortechnicalimaginary.That is,it isnot only restructuring the mechanisms and structures, but the very possibility of thinking against them.Part of theparadoxof availaibility,however,isthat the'deeper' structures are progressively hidden and offered instead through a simplified 'interface'. In computational capitalism this affects not just the what we think of as naturally computational, for example a laptop, but also other technical and mechanical devices that are reconfigured through this paradigm. 

Internals of an Apple II computer (introduced 1977) and Apple’s 2012 Retina Macbook Pro (Begemann 2012). 

Engine compartments of a 1982 Mercedes-Benz Series 190 (W-201) and a 2010 Mercedes Benz Concept Car called “Shooting Break” (Begemann 2012). 
Here we see how this computational means to black-boxing the mechanism, and the affordancesthat computationgrants,eg.miniaturisation,concretisation,obfuscation, andsoforth,becomepart of theway-of-doingwithinconsumercapitalism.The computer becomes increasing dense and aestheticised (even internally as shown above) and the access point is through the obligatory passage points of the interface. Equally, the car reveals a similar logic of hiddenness and obfuscation, with the driver, now user,given an 'interface' to the engine and associated mechanicalsystem.These interfaces are built on rational and directed process of reason, what we might call 'merereason'asasubset of possibleways-of-doingoracting.Thisisalsowherethe logic of computationality and the practices of computational consumer capitalism converge in the creation of technical devices with inbuilt obsolescence and limited means for repair or maintainence. 
Kant argues that ‘mere reason’ (rather than ‘pure reason’) is a programmed structure, with in-built possibilities of "misfiring", and nothing but calculation as a way of seeing right.Thecomputerisatechnologythat causedDerridasomeconcernforprecisely the reason that it attempt to substitute for the flux of everyday experience an appearance of certainty that cannot represent human experiences adequately (Golumbia2009:16). “Mere”reasonisnot likethetwomajorcategoriesof cognition, “pure” and “practical” reason, specifically because in its quest for exactness and precision it actually eliminates the possibility of human agency in thinking or cognitive practice. 
Driven by rapid changes in technology and particularly innovation in social media, we are seeing a transition fromstatic information to real-time data.Real-time data streams are new ways to consume various media forms through data stream providerslikeTwitter.Infact it canbearguedthat Twitterisnowthedefactoreal•timemessagebusof theinternet.Thisnewwayof accessing,distributing,and communicating via the real-time stream is still playing out and raises interesting questionsabout howit affectspolitics,economics,social,anddailylife.But there’s also the question of what does the real-time stream do to the aesthetic experience? Particularly when the real-time mediates art or becomes a site for artistic installation or innovation. 
To pick up a theme introduced early in the book, we have continually questioned and critiqued the behaviour gestured towards in earlier discussions of the New Aesthetic asa way-of-seeing,oreven a way-of-being.This passivity suggested in a subjectivity linked to the New Aesthetic that elsewhere has been described by Berry (2011) as a riparian subject or raparian user.That is a subject that is encouraged to follow, watch, or consume streams of data without necessarily participating in any meaningfulwayin the stream.Here, 
riparianrefer[s]totheact of watchingtheflowof thestreamgoby.But as, 
Kierkegaard, writing about the rise of the mass media argued: The public is not a 
people, a generation, one’s era, not a community, an association, nor these 
particular persons, for all these are only what they are by virtue of what is 
concrete.Not asingleoneof thosewhobelongtothepublichasanessential 
engagement with anything (Berry 2011: 144). 
Above we gestured already towards the softwarization of 'close reading', and the changing structure of a ‘preferred reader’ or subject position towards one that is increasingly algorithmic (of course, this could be a human or non-human reader). Indeed it is suggestive that as a result of these moves to real-time streams that we will see the move from a linear model of narrative, exemplified by books, to a ‘dashboard of a calculation interface’ and ‘navigational platforms’, exemplified by new formsof softwareplatforms.Indeed,theseplatforms,andherewearethinkingof a screenic interface such as the iPad, allow the ‘reader’ to use the hand-and-eye in haptic interfaces to develop interactive exploratory approaches towards knowledge/informationand‘discovery’.Thiscould,of course,stillenablehumanitistic notions of ‘close reading’ but the preferred reading style would increasingly be ‘distant reading’.Partially,orcompletely,mediated throughcomputationalcode-based devices.Non-linear,fragmentary,partialand pattern-matching software taking in real•time streams and presenting to the user a mode of cognition that is hyper attention based coupled withreal-time navigationaltools.Thus, 
the riparian user is strangely connected, yet simultaneously disconnected, to the data streams that are running past at speeds which are difficult to keep up with. To be a member of the riparian public one must develop the ability to recognise patterns,to discern narratives,and to aggregate the data flows.Orto use cognitivesupport technologiesandsoftwaretodoso.Theripariancitizenis continually watching the flow of data, or delegating this ‘watching’ to a technical deviceoragent todosoontheirbehalf.It willrequirenewcomputationalabilities for them to make sense of their lives, to do their work, and to interact with both other people and the technologies that make up the datascape of the real-time web (Berry 2011: 144). 
11. THE POLITICS OF EMERGENT AESTHETICS 
In the well-known lecture, ‘What is Critique?’ Foucault traces "the critical attitude" from the "high Kantian enterprise" (to know knowledge) to everyday polemics found in governmentality.Inthisway,criticalityisastancethat followsmodernity:anact of defiance by limiting, exiting and transforming historically constituted arrangements of power.Foucault referred to critique in this context as “the art of not being governed, orbettertheart of not beinggovernedlikethat,orat that cost”(2007:45).Expressed as a will, this is conveyed by a suspension of judgment that drives praxis into a direct involvement with prevailing conditions of possibility and power/knowledge, he adds, 
If governmentalization is...this movement through which individuals are subjugated in the reality of a social practice through mechanisms of power that adhere to a truth, well, then! I will say that critique is the movement by which the subject gives himself the right to question truth on its effects of powerandquestionpoweronitsdiscoursesof truth.(Foucault 2007:47) 
This reconfiguration of problems is suggestive of a way to suspend the riparian user within the altered historical context of computationality and neoliberal govermentality. Consider the practices associated with media art: hacking, free and open source software,net criticismandsoon.ConsiderPhilipAgre'sinfluentialframeworkof 'critical technical practice' (1997) or, more recently, Julian Oliver, Gordan Savi••i••, and Danja Vasiliev's 'Critical Engineering Manifesto', 
The Critical Engineer considers any technology depended upon to be both a challenge and a threat.The greaterthe dependence on a technology the greater the need to study and expose its inner workings, regardless of ownershiporlegalprovision...raisesawarenessthat witheach technological advance our techno-political literacy is challenged. (Oliver, Savi••i•• & Vasiliev 2011). 
Suchexamples aimto process existing regimes precisely throughtheircapacityto suspend or reconfigure any 'correct' techniques and contexts for engaging with informational infrastructures, whether commercial interfaces, platform services, junked hardware,atmosphericsensors,network trafficorgeo-tagged data.We are suggesting that these practices work to hack the relational, affective and algorithmic logics of neoliberal subjectivity to the extent that we begin to actively think with these infrastructures in new ways, apply a threshold of encouragement to break privatized senses of risk and loss, to diagram structural violences, to reconfigure at-risk ecologiesof practices,andsotofosterdifferent modesof comportment.If critique always forms within pre-existing conditions and settings, it does so through 'voluntary disobedience.' 
There are, of course, constant and ongoing risks involved in critique, and in critical cultural practices, since they are provoked by difficulties carried along by insecurity andprecariousnessitself.Nevertheless,weshouldnot bedisheartenedor disappointed bythese challenges.As JudithButlerarguesin hercommentaryon Foucault’s lecture, this is "a moment of ethical questioning which requires that we break the habits of judgment in favor of a riskier practice that seeks to yield artistry fromconstraint"(Butler2001).Themoment,ormovement,of critiqueisnot basedon correcting errors or mistakes, but on a 'virtue' of questioning the limits themselves. 
Critical aesthetic practices tend to involve pulling open conductions of control, surfacing from twisted ensembles of things, dragging their problematic configurations intoview.Sucheffortshavebeencentraltomediaart inthepast,but howcanthese practices be fostered under current configurations of compulationalism and the destructive tendencies of neoliberal governmentality? Can the New Aesthetic illuminate these ecologies of practices in new ways, to light up for an instant the investments, subjectivities and conflicts that define a critical network culture?

A key premise of this book has rested on a relatively uncontroversial claim that the digital, especially software, is an increasingly important aspect of our post-Fordist informationalsocietiesandculturalpractices.Wehavetakenasynopticlookat the digital through the phenomenon of the New Aesthetic, the questions it raises, and the styleof comportment that it suggests.Thisexperiment inthinkingthepresent through collaborative and interdisciplinary authorship has enabled us to consider the profound ways in which computationality and neoliberal governmentality are imbricated within emerging aesthetic forms,expressions,logics and effects.The 'deep' materialityof the digital crystallizes particular social forms and values, but also generates new mentalities in combination witheconomic forms and socialrelations.Thisnotion of computationality as ontotheology indicates the prevailing doxa of a digitally material world. Indeed, as Marx argued, 
Technology reveals the active relation of man to nature, the direct process of the production of his life, and thereby it also lays bare the process of production of the social relations of his life, and of the mental conceptions that flow from these conceptions (Marx 2007: 493, footnote 4). 
We are not suggesting here that excesses of instrumental reason, delegated into machines, have created a totalitarian dystopia where the computational and the instrumentalhavebecomesynonomous.That isareadingof technologythat Heidegger criticized as a poor understanding of technology which remains "caught in thesubject/object picture"(Dreyfus1997).InHeidegger'sfinalanalysis,thegoalof technologywas"somethingcompletelydifferent andthereforenew"(1977:5).It involved increasingly efficient orderings of resources simply for the sake of this orderingandit hascreatedaworldinwhich"everythingisorderedtostandby,tobe immediately at hand, indeed to stand there just so that it may be on call for a further ordering"(1977:17).Crucially,it'sat thislevelthat wehavebeendrawinglinks between computationality, thought and comportment. 
Neoliberal Re-Forms 
We now find ourselves in a situation of increasing reliance on digital technologies of computationandcalculativerationalities.Manyof thesesystemswereinitially designed to support or aid the judgement of people in undertaking specific activities, analyses, and decisions, but they have long since "surpassed the understanding of theirusersand become indispensible to them" (Weizenbaum1984:236).Witha lack of adequate technical literacy, combined with processes of blackboxing, these systemsthemselvesresist interrogability.Accordingly,inourcurrent dependencyon computationality, such infrastructures tend toward growth, through addition of control at higherandhigherlevelsof abstraction(Beniger,1986).Indeed,asKitchin(2011) argues, software can tie in strongly with specific regimes of governmentality, in dense and complicated patterns and dynamics: 
Over the past two centuries a mode of governmentality has developed in Western society that is heavily reliant on generating and monitoring systematicinformationabout individualsbyinstitutions.Software-enabled technologiesqualitativelyalterboththedepthandthescopeof this disciplinary gaze, but also introduce new forms of governance, because they make the systems and apparatus of governance more panoptical in nature.At thetechnicallevel,softwareisproducingnewmachine-readable and software-sorted geographies that are radically altering how cities are regulated… Software creates more effective systems of surveillance and creates new capture systems that actively reshape behaviour by altering thenatureof atask.Inrecent yearstherehasbeenmuchacademic attention paid to qualitative changes in surveillance technologies as they have become digital in nature, leading to the development of a new field of surveillancestudies.That said,thereisstillmuchconceptualandempirical work to be done to understand how forms of governance are being transformed and the role played by software, and not simply the broader technologiesthey enable.(Kitchin 2011:949) 
Neoliberalism’s deep penetration into subjectivity, or what Foucault called subjectivation, pulls economized, 'market-civilization' thinking into social spheres in waysthat workindestructiveandatomizingregisters.Thisisoneof thechallenges,in our view, marked by the New Aesthetic. 
Drawing on Lauren Berlant’s conception of mediatized subjectives that attune to such presents by finding form (2011), we have considered the New Aesthetic as just one kind of affectively compelling genre that had success as a 'concept' for hinging oneself toanobfuscatedpresent.Fromspecificconditionsof possibility,it spokeof patterns, computational regimes and economic conditions that had become very much ourown.The New Aesthetic twisted conventionalanxieties; forus,the predictable resistanceseemedtoostaid,evenforthosewhowereambivalent about it.This phenomenon showed us that to think aesthetic encounters now, we need to think differently.TheNewAestheticisolatestheurgencyof ourneedfornewconcepts:to be clearer on how the dynamics of civil society have become increasingly eroded away and are being reworked by computational technologies and neoliberal technocratic orders. 
These relate to aesthetics of comportment, to orientations with objects, relationships, thingsandcommunities.Experimentalart andcriticalprojectsmight attempt tothink through these infrastructures by playing with and breaking the logics and medial affordances differently.We are emphasizing the urgency preciselybecause allof this plays out on the topos provided by computational technologies, on loose, hazy neoliberalized social fabrics, which in a similar way to software, render older forms of attachmentsandsubject positionsirrelevant.AsGelernterargues: 
No moment in technology history has ever been more exciting or dangerous than 'now.' As we learn more about now, we know less about then.TheInternet increasesthesupplyof informationhugely,but the capacity of the human mind not at all… The effect of nowness resembles the effect of light pollution in large cities, which makes it impossible to see the stars.A flood of information about the present shuts out the past (Gelernter 2010). 
Irruptions of the Digital into the Real, Economics into ‘Culture’ 
Writing in the Dutch context, we understand the contemporary period’s inattention to the effects on the subject of neoliberal transition as symptomatic of the success of its ideologicaltakeover.Emerging aesthetic forms and criticalpracticescan raise important questions about the autonomy and continuity of the human agent in this present where matters of autonomy for cultural practitioners and critics are becoming increasingly stressed and questioned. 
In such contexts, moving toward a technological politics is necessary.Consider for example that the auto-curation of the stream's processing – Tumblr blogs, Twitter feeds,andsoforth -doesnot just provideinformationtotheuser,but alsoactively constructs, directs, and even newly creates, significant socio-cognitive conditions for the subjectivity of the real-time stream, a kind of algorithmic humanity.This is how the subject is captured by the New Aesthetic, whose comportment seems hooked to the minimizationof risk,andshot throughwithprojectivesentimentality.Wefeel phenomena such this might, as Derrida has argued, 
Oblige us more than ever to think the virtualization of space and time, the possibility of virtual events whose movement and speed prohibit us more than ever (more and otherwise than ever, for this is not absolutely and thoroughly new) from opposing presence to its representation, 'real time' to 'deferred time,' effectivity to its simulacrum, the living to the non-living, in short, the living to the living-dead of its ghosts (Derrida 1994: 212). 
Software changes the games of cultural work and production; the lesson takes a long time to learn and iscomplicated by otherparallelconditions.The neoliberaleconomyis not just driven by software as a kind of symbolic machine but instead is made of software,asGallowayhasemphasized(2012a).It fostersinalogicof “theextraction of valuebasedontheencodingandprocessingof mathematicalinformation”(10).But this is not just to say that software is a kind of conceptual motor underpinning the economy, and useful for thinking it through: “more and more, software is the thing whichis directlyextracting value” (10).ForGalloway,thissoftware condition,like our crisis-ridden economic condition, is impossible to "wish away;" there is contrarilly a "special relation today between the mode of production and its mathematics" (11).TheNewAestheticfoundthisspecialrelation,initsabsolutelydirect capturingof its patterns, channels and economies of attention. 
Implications of an Apolitical New Aesthetic 
If it is not obvious by now, we have been as a collective differently innervated, perplexedandambivalent about thisthingcalledtheNewAesthetic.Whileweare keen to distance ourselves from a possible passive reading/writing of its style, a style that we have described as riparian, in as much as it encourages consumption of a certain kind of digital product(ion), the New Aesthetic as a case has delivered to us more understanding of the present condition and the possibilities of using media to reconfigurethingsalittle.Thewaythat thephenomenasostronglylinked computationwithconsumptionandaspectsof theneoliberaleconomicreality, enabled us to generate new insights and questions; for example, about the care for artistic and creative work, that we have captured in the curatorial anxieties stressed in themiddlesectionof thisbook.It hasfelt crucial,moreover,that thesecomplex assocations that we have generated in proximity to the thing create reflexive articulations.Here,we are recognizing ourown potentialbreaks fromcomputational and calculative reason.As Darrow Schecternotes, 
The exercise of power and the formalisation of knowledge to be intimately bound up with the constitution of living individuals as subjects of knowledge, that is, as citizens and populations about whom knowledge is systematicallyconstructed...Subjectsarenot bornsubjectssomuchas theybecomethem.Inthecourseof becomingsubjectstheyareclassified in innumerable ways which contribute to their social integration, even if theyare simultaneously marginalised in manycases.(Schecter2010:171) 
Our neoliberal selves have become more strongly attached to the norms of 'market civilization' through specific combinations of rationalities, strategies, technologies and techniques that mobilize government at a distance, and by manipulations of power throughtheeconomicanddiscursivenetworksof amassivelyderegulatedand expanding new media (Gupta and Sharma: 2006). 
The most conventional anxiety around neoliberal subject formation is that this mode of governmentality reduces citizens to consumers only, enfolding all of life and culture toitsrepresentationalpractices.Thisisitslogicof course,but it cannot beeverfully achieved.AsWendyBrown(2006)hasargued,thedifferenceof theregimesand practices of neoliberal transition is that they emphasize market rationality as an already-achieved state,ratherthan an aspiration.Thisgivesneoliberalisma teleologicalforceandordinarinessthat isdifficult tocounter,andunpack.It is significant twist of already-realized market rationalization that has significant ramifications not just on a theory of the subject, but following from this, on any theory of thespectatororuserof art,media,design,andculture.TheNewAesthetic acknowledges the ensconcement of neoliberalism in subjectivity, but to think aesthetics 'now', how can we think beyond this? 
Indeed,therearehugedifficulties.Totheextent that neoliberalgovernmentality subordinates state power to the requirements of the marketplace, 'political problems' become literally privatized, while citizens are simultaneously promised new levels of freedom,consumerism,customisation,interactivity and controlovertheirlives.This exacerbatesanxietyabout whethersuchfreedomscanbeclaimedorregistered.In other words, the subject is promised an unfulfilled expectation, to the extent they are abletoexert theirindividualagency.Whiletheliberalsubject aspiredtoownherlabour and was mobilized by related ideals (inverted in Marx), the neoliberal subject is tasked not just with 'looking after themselves,' but with totally embodying their own human capital biopolitically and over time: as gathered, contextually adaptive, and collateral. 
This is of huge relevance to a politics of aesthetics, since once the subject becomes figured as their own human capital, it erodes away the distinction between figure and ground, production and reproduction, creating mobile, speculative identifications, such that wehaveobservedintheNewAesthetic.Thesubject'scomportment towards constant growth is both necessary and precarious, as growth is considered more important than returns; the subject invests in opportunities, selves, presence, objects, tools, computer learning and so on, to maximize claims on the real (see Boltanski and Chiapello 2006). 
In order to facilitate neoliberal governence, certain infrastructural and technocratic systems have been put in place; bureaucratic structures, compatible computational agenciesandsoforth.But it isclearthat providinginformationtocitizensisnot sufficient forcontrollingandinfluencingbehaviour.People'sabilitytounderstandand manipulate raw data or information is more limited in many contexts; there is a heavy relianceonhabit,understoodaspart of thehumancondition.Ascomputational procedures pick up more of this ordering work, goals and projects come to be co•expressed within a computational structure: real-time streams that are procedural, algorithmic, modular, and quantitatively expressed, are very amenable to neoliberalism.Indeed,theidentitiesorrolesthat wetakeonenableustocarry ourselves computationally,throughself-tracking,life-hacking,monitoring,etc.Clearly, these also link to the representational practices of a passive New Aesthetic. 
TheNewAestheticsentimentalizessomeof thesehardfacts.Meanwhile,the ideological encroachment of market rationalization, which the curators among us have found it critical to think with, especially in proximity to the concept of care and artistic labour, has significant ramifications not just on a theory of the subject, but on approaches to critical practice around emergent aesthetic forms. 
New Aesthetic: Critique as Practice 
A concept often referenced from Foucault is his notion of 'problematicization.' During a late interview with Paul Rabinow, he explained this as an act of thought involving the process of defining a problem(Foucault:2000).Problematization is a rare concerted effort that occurswhenconfrontedwith‘difficulties’that arisefrompolitical,social andeconomicprocesses.Thesedifficultiessometimescatalyzethought by interrupting its consistency; they provoke multifaceted or opposing responses, but 
ultimately responses that together posit a constitutive context of the problematic. 

Under such conditions, thought, for Foucault, is that which allows one to 'step back' from conduct, to present conduct as an object of thought and to question its meaning, goals and conditions: “thought is freedom in relation to what one does, the motion by which one detaches from it, establishes it as an object, and reflects on it as aproblem”(Foucault 2000:117).Thismotionof freeingupconduct istheobject of Foucault’swork,but alsohispractice.Inotherwords,problematizationsaresought out andre-positedinuntimelywaysinthepresent.Here,“what isimportant iswhat makes them simultaneously possible: it is the point in which their simultaneity is rooted; it is the soil that can nourish them all in their diversity and sometimes in spite of their contradictions” (Foucault 2000: 118) The re-positing of problems themselves 
–anact of bothdiscoveryandcreation–isthedomainof critique.Howdoesthis work? There exists a strange doubling in the notion of re-positing a problem – a gesture of heterogenesis that cannot be secured through a set of formal criteria, nor a morality of solutions, but always a kind of movement that grapples with its own constitution. 
We understand that emerging aesthetic and critical practices do have potential to createsuchmovements.Theypresent opportunitiestorethinknot onlythecontext of media art, but a variety of situated practices, including speculative design, net criticism, hacking, free and open source software development, locative media, sustainable hardware and so on.Thisishow we have considered the New Aesthetic: as an opportunity to rethink the relations between these contexts in the emergent episteme of computationality.There is a desperate need to confront the political pressuresof neoliberalismmanifestedintheseinfrastructures.WeagreewithHal Fosterinarecent essay,"surelynowisabadtimetogopost-critical"(2012).Indeed, these are risky, dangerous and problematic times, and these are periods when critique should thrive, but here we need to forge new alliances, invent and discover problems of the common that nevertheless do not eliminate the fundamental differences in this ecologyof practices(Stengers2005).Here,perhapsprovocatively,webelieveagreat deal could be learned from the development of the New Aesthetic not only as a mood, but asatopicandfixforcollectivefeeling,that temporarilymobilizesnetworks.Isit possible to sustain and capture these atmospheres of debate and discussion beyond knee-jerk reactions and opportunistic self-promotion? These are crucial questions that the New Aesthetic invites us to consider, if only to keep a critical network culture in place. 
New Aesthetics: Practice as Resistance 
Any range of emerging aesthetic forms, processing these conditions, could offer certain 'exploits' to surface the digital and its inequalities and control in different ways (ThackerandGalloway,2007).What wemight callthe'knowledgeinfrastructure'isan important possible site of resistance in itself, reinforced through the diffusion of technologiesof theinformationsociety.Thiscanclearlybeseeninthepracticesof the hackers of the free software and open source movements and their critical practices anddiscourses.Whilst wehavenot hadspaceortimetoengagewiththesehacking practices in relation to the New Aesthetic here, it is clear that the overlaps, synergies and connections remain relevant – here we think of open access, piracy, and glitch as some of the possible critical movements that also have a popular following and link to currentlyexistingculturalpractices.Therearealsoimportant critiquestobe established and interventions to be made in a constantly strengthening and contentious regime of intellectual property rights which walk hand-in-hand with the growing institutionalisation of the informative part of theeconomy.It remainsthecase that the onward march of copyright and patent regimes is not just overbearing, but in somecasesthreatenslifeitself.Thedimensionsof acriticalmaking-visibleof computationality, accordingly, must remain linked to an aesthetic practice, 
New technologies and new ways of using information are continually being developed and these serve to question our assumptions about copyright andcreativity.Thecurrent criminalisationof piracy,data‘theft’and hacking are the latest salvos by industries trying to restrict the flow and useof theircreativework.It isinterestingtonotethat theownersof these creative works are seldom the creators and pressure for the extension and strengthening of copyright comes almost exclusively from the multinational corporations.Thisalone should raise questions as to who isbenefiting from the rise in intellectual property protection (Berry 2008: 28). 
We might consider how creative works are increasingly distributed through parameterization, data-pours and the 'embed' mechanism, which, of course, Tumblr alsouses.Theseareimportant dimensionsof comprehensionandcritique(Liu2004). For exampe, certain national copyright regimes have been structured to create 'safe harbours'forparticularwaysof usingandsharingdigitalculturemoregenerally.At the level of the screenic these practices have increasingly become invisible to the user, who remains bolstered by the ease of flow of the streams of data across the browser onscreen, whilst computational processes mediate the 'correct' use of copyrighted materials,displayauthorisations,andsoforth.Needlesstosay,whilst alsocollecting so-called 'tracking' data about how the screen and interface are used through the use of compactants and related technologies (Berry, 2012a). 
The New Aesthetic and Everyday Life 
In so far as neoliberal governmentality also subordinates state power to the requirements of the marketplace, political problems turn to be re-presented or cast in market terms.If theNewAestheticconcernstheubiquityof digitalandnetworked systems, then think about how computation has challenged and reconfigured the ways in which citizens and subjects now understand themselves, for example: (1) Education – How well educated and literate or people in relation to the digital structureof thecontemporaryworld.Howactivearetheyintheirparticipationinthe politics of digital technology, (2) Health -What typically is the condition of people’s physicalstrengthand health,additionallytheirmentaland physicalskillsfor development and coping? (3) How well acquainted are people with the arts in digital culture and how proficient are they in artistic practices and their relation to them; and lastly (4) Conviviality -How compassionate are people privately as citizens of ‘informational societies’? How devoted are they to helping others who suffer deprivation and hardship? How conciliatory are they towards their opponents and enemies in network cultures (flame wars, etc.)? 
Clearly too, the New Aesthetic as the surface manifestation of the computational device, its politics, has been useful for gaining only so many hooks on the comprehension of the present and the possible forms of practice and critique towards thiscondition.Weconsideredfirstlythat theNewAestheticisanideological manifestation of a computational ontotheology being instantiated in a number of medial moments (technology, politics, social movements, the environment, the state). We also wished to deconstruct its attractive manifestation of the commodity form as endswithout means,ineffect anexampleof commodityfetishism.Finally,ourcritique impliesanewformof literacy,whichelsewhereBerry(2012c)hascalled'iteracy,'able to understand and intervene directly in the technological system we inhabit. 
Cognitively, it has been argued that streams are also suited to a type of reading called ‘distant reading’ as opposed to the ‘close reading’ of the humanities (Moretti 2007). This ‘close reading’ has created a certain type of subject: narrativised, linear, what McLuhancalled'typographicman'(1962).At present,thereisaparadoxical relationship between the close reading currently taught in educational institutions and thedistant readingrequiredforalgorithmicapproachestoinformation.Toillustrate, books are a great example of a media form that uses typographic devices for aiding cognition for ‘close’ reading: chapters, paragraphs, serif fonts, avoiding textual 'rivers' andwhitespace.Most notably,thesewereinstantiatedintoprofessionaltypographic practices that are themselves now under stress from computational algorithmic approaches to typesetting and production.Close reading devices required a deep sense of awareness in relation to the reader as a particular conscious and active subject: autonomous, linear, narrativised, and capable of feats of memory and cognitive processing.Devices,meanwhile,were associated witha constellation of practices that were surrounded around the concept of the author. 
We want to extend this observation and consider how neoliberalism and computation complement each other, but where nonetheless this complementarity opens folds for critically thinking through the issues and questions that are raised both by the new aestheticandthenewanxietiesit appearstointroduce.Crucially,Foucault's perspective on criticality, introduced at the start of this chapter, suggests the possibility of a subject manifested within arrangements of power, whilst nonetheless capable of drawing limits, capable of being a line-of-flight within computationality. Here, as Schecter notes, 
Critical thinking can deconstruct the visible harmony between casual seeingandinstrumentalreason...incontrast withmonolithicappearances, surfaces are characterised by strata and folds that can inflect power to create new truths, desires and forms of experience (Schecter 2010: 175). 
This link between perception (not just visuality) and power raises the question of an aestheticitself deployedtowardsintelligibility.Tumblrs,andrelatedcollection-oriented computational systems certainly contribute to visualizing forms of understanding, throughthe generation of geometric and photographic truths manifested in painted 
screensandsurfaces.However,thereisstillimportant criticalandcreativeworktobe 

done to fully confront this reality of 21st century visual culture, one that is computationally mediated and saturated withconsumerismand markets.Indeed,we would argue that the question remains not one of finding the representational New Aesthetic, but the conscious and active cultivation of new aesthetics (plural).
