#The Lyrics of Mark E Smith
Right noise.
We're gonna get real speedy
You gotta wear black all the time
You're gonna make it on your own.


Cos we dig
Cos we dig
We dig
We dig repetition
We dig repetition
We've repetition in the music
And we're never going to lose it.


All you daughters and sons
who are sick of fancy music
We dig repetition
Repetition on the drums
and we're never going to lose it.


This is the three R's
The three R's:
Repetition, Repetition, Repetition


Oh mental hospitals
Oh mental hospitals
They put electrodes in your brain
And you're never the same
You don't dig repetition
You don't love repetition


Repetition in the music and we're never going to loose it


President Carter loves repetition
Chairman Mao he dug repetition


Repetition in China
Repetition in America
Repetition in West Germany
Simultaneous suicides


We dig it, we dig it,
we dig it, we dig it


Repetition, repetition, repetition
Repetition, repetition, Regal Zonophone

There is no hesitation
This is your situation
Continue a blank generation
Blank generation
Same old blank generation
Groovy blank generation
Swinging blank generation


Repetition, repetition, repetition....


BINGO MASTERS BREAKOUT 

Two swans in front of his eyes
Colored balls in front of his eyes
It's number one for his Kelly's eye
Treble-six right over his eye


A big shot's voice in his ears
Worlds of silence in his ears
All the numbers account for years
Checks the cards through eyes of tears


Bingo-Master's Breakout!


All he sees is the back of chairs
In the mirror, a lack of hairs
A light room, which he fills out
Hear the players all shout


Bingo-Master's Breakout!


A glass of lager in his hand
Silver microphone in his hand
Wasting time in numbers and rhyme
One hundred blank faces buy


Bingo-Master's Breakout!


Came the time he flipped his lid
Came the time he flipped his lid
Holiday in Spain fell through
Players put it down to


Bingo-Master's Breakout


A hall full of cards left unfilled
Ended his life with wine and pills
There's a grave somewhere only partly filled
A sign in a graveyard on a hill reads


Bingo-Master's Breakout


PSYCHO MAFIA 


Spitting on the streets
Numb heads and feet
Nowhere to go
Won't let us in the shows


'Cos we talk about love
And the Psycho-Mafia
I'm talking 'bout love
And the Psycho-Mafia


No soul in the discos
No rock in the clubs
Won't let us in the pubs
And the city joys


Going on about love
And the Psycho-Mafia
I'm talking about love
And the Psycho-Mafia


Psycho-Mafia
Psycho-Mafia
'cho Mafia
'cho Mafia


Spitting on the streets
Shot heads and teeth
Our eyes are red
Our brains are dead


Going on about drugs
Psycho-Mafia
I'm talking about love
Psycho-Mafia


VARIOUS TIMES 

Alright we're going to go back
to 1940
No money
And I live in Berlin
I think I'll join up
Become a camp guard
No war for me
An old Jew's face dripping red


I hate the prisoners
I hate the officers
They've no fight
I think I'll join,
The red rose,
Leave Belsen
I'll go to Switzerland
A human resistor
Don't think, ask him


Present :
I don't like them
said Ian
in his black-out threat
I think I'll drop out
Become a no-man
And live my rules
But I'm the sort that gets
out of the bath with a dirty face


Everyone I meet's the same now
No brains or thought
A good case for the systems we like - we get
Human race
Various times
Don't think, ask him


Future:
1980
Black windows
And smokey holes
My head is full of lead
And the beer is so weak
Since they got rid of time around here


Dr. Doom fresh from Salem
And the witch trials
The Lathe of Heaven
Time mistaken
Three places at once
Human race
Don't think, ask him
Ask him
Ask him


IT'S THE NEW THING 

My boys take what I say
Do it the studio way
New equipment all clean
New gear 
Clothes mean
I answer and take the calls
No trouble with the law
Turn it up for interviewers
Oh yeah prime movers
I wonder what is next year's thing?
Crash smash crash ring

They've got another side
Pop heroes of the mind
While you suckers queue or work
Money for us and play it up
We have never sold out
Spent hours on a clever act
Phoney advertising quotes that make you buy some raise your hopes
That it's the new leather thing
Crash smash crash ring

The broken backs of the real bands
A million closed minds
Weep for the old glam
Year of the average man
The Worst died because of you
Along with some others too
Erasing off our rainbows
We are men, we have big toes!
It's the new leather thing
Crash smash crash ring


Houdini believed his tricks
That is why he died
Oh I'm not coming out
There may be a film on tonight
Or Eliot's Untouchables
As for new hotels
Look like science fiction films or revival gothic pigswill
Watch the skies, what to think
Crash smash crash ring
[Bramah:] Rocket! / Rock it!


It's the new leather thing
Ba ba ba doo.....
New leather thing

Yow!


ROWCHE RUMBLE 

Rowche Rumble
Is valium
Valium
Valium
Rowche Rumble
That's rumble


Thousands of wives around the world
are given them by doctors, who think they're little girls
The doctors need prescriptions
The wives need their pill
So Rowche Rumble


Menopause wives are hard to handle
No culture or love, no gambles
The dull manage, especially smashed
on Rowche Rumble
Rowche Rumble


Physician, heal thyself


Our government's built on expense accounts
Once in, never out
A step to Rowche
Force feeding
What are the people around you taking?
Rowche Rumble


Now I've tried crazy things
Abusing my body to a quick end
But I'll never never never never do it again
I said I'll never never never never do it again
Rowche Rumble


Physician, heal thyself.
Musician, heal thyself.
Hey mister, heal thyself.


Loads of people across the land
Do a prescribed death dance
While condemning speed and grass
They got an addiction like a hole in the ass
Rowche Rumble
Rowche Rumble


I send 70 pounds instead of 70 p to
pharmaceutical company Rowche AG
The lorry arrived the next day
Swiss gnomes dealing out potions
Kick your liver in
What is it the fear for?
[To decant the beer]
...the full use of your body isn't?


Rowche Rumble
Is valium
That's rumble


Note: Rowche is a play on the name of the giant Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche


IN MY AREA 

The dwarf plays pool to prove his height
People play games when they lose in life
There's no sport, lad, just acid tension stomach flash
A madness in my area


I have seen the birth of bad
I have seen declining tracks
I have seen the madness in my area


Understand time till I'm asked about it
Years cross-check, days become a tick
Can't remember who I've sacked, just stupid faces looking bad
The madness in my area


I have seen the birth of bad
I have seen declining tracks
I have seen the madness in my area


Former friends suck on the Fall
Genuine white crap article.
Their future cries
of broken pain are idiot victims'.
Just adds to the madness in my area


I have seen the birth of bad
I have seen declining tracks
I have seen the madness in my area


Politic comic fools in full bloom
McCarthy reincarnate soon
See the bones on the two-late faces
The me generation
See the traces of
The madness in my area


I have seen the birth of bad
I have seen the declining tracks
I have seen the madness in my area


I have seen the burrowmen
Frozen pain that is so bad
I have seen the madness in my area
Madness in my empire
In the writer
The Berlin fighter
In the mirror
The doppelganger
The new satire [boozed satyr?]

Blood and sand....


DICE MAN 

I am the dice man
And I take a chance, huh
Do you take a chance, huh?


Where you two going?
Where you two going?
Is this a branch on the tree of showbusiness?


Do all these musicians
Have a social conscience?
Well, only in their front rooms


But I am the dice man
And I take a chance man
Do you take a chance, huh?


They stay with the masses
Don't take any chances
End up emptying ashtrays


But I push, push, push, push
Throw the bones and the poison dice
No time for small moralists


Cos I am the dice man
And I take a chance, huh
Do you take a chance, fan?


They say music should be fun
Like reading a story of love
But I wanna read a horror story
Where are you people going?
Where are you people going?
Is this a branch on the tree of showbusiness?


But I am the dice man
A balls-on-the-line man
Do you take a chance, baby?

Note: Dice Man refers to the novel by the same name by Luke Rhinehart

Helen Duncan[1] was accused of being a fraudulent medium
They burst into a seance over a over in Portsmouth, over a chemists shop
A length of ectoplasm or a suit of cheesecloth
Was grabbed but it got away
The Witchcraft Act 1735 was used to give her 9 month's jail
The vibrations will live on

Never Mind
It's quester psykick dance-hall
Get aboard for

Step forward, step forward

Note: [1] Helen Duncan: Scottish medium; last person to be charged and found guilty under an old witchcraft statute in 1944; sentenced to nine months imprisonment


SECOND DARK AGE 

Fat conference women
Clap return of glass house
And the Arabs have it made
Oil is women in veils, eyes glazed

Second Dark Age. Death of the USA.
Return of the family.
The scooter cabbages

And the commune crapheads sit and whine
While the common near my birthplace is now a police college

It's a second dark age.
No Psalm Sunday or any day. 
The city is dead.
Bust. Ghost-dance rite. Tepid

I could join a pray-peace group
Spy in Norway
Cause groups can change the world
and meet Bjorn and Benny [1]
"Hi I am Benny"
Go where the brave prance
No Czechoslovak food queues are a party, fool

A mediocre anti-Jew
And single people are screwed
in the Second Dark Age

I am Roman Totale XVII
the bastard offspring
of Charles I and the Great God Pan.

Note: [1] Abba reference


FIERY JACK 

My face is slack
And kidneys burn
In the small of my back
Will never learn
Well I'm not going back
To the slow life
Cos every step is a drag
And peace is a kite of materials you never catch
Come up for a snatch
Up from hell
Once in a while

Cause I am Jack
From a burning ring
My face is slack
And I think think think

I just think think think
Too fast to write
Too fast to work
Just burn burn burn

I sat and drank
For three decades
I'm 45
Cause I am Jack
From a burning ring
And my face is slack
And I think think think
I just drink drink drink
Too fast to work
Too fast to write
I just burn burn burn

I eat hot dogs
I live on pies
I'm 45
Cause I am Jack
And I think think think
Just think think think
Too fast to write
Too fast to work
Just burn burn burn

And put down left-wing tirades
and the musical trades
And/or free trade
I say eat this grenade
To defend free trade
I said eat this grenade

Cause I am Jack
Some men from the docks
They are smart
Their brains are half
They never end
Just follow trends

But I am Jack
From a burning ring
My face is slack
And I think think think
Just think think think
Too fast to write
Too fast to work
I just burn burn burn
I am Jack
And put down left-wing tirades
and the musical trades
And/or free trade
I said eat this grenade
I said eat this grenade
Andall free trade
I said eat this grenade

Note: The line "I just burn burn burn" likely comes from Johnny Cash's Ring Of Fire.




STEPPING OUT 

I used to believe everything I read (x3)
But that's all changed and now I'm stepping out
That's all changed and now I'm
Stepping out (x3)

I used to stay in the house and never go out
But now I'm stepping out, stepping out
I used to stay in the house and never go out
But now I'm stepping out, stepping out, stepping out

I used to stay on my feet all 24 hours
But now I'm stepping out, stepping out
The light'd be on 24 hours
But now I'm stepping out, stepping out, stepping out

So people get ready, strip down your houses
Cause I'm stepping out, stepping out
So people get ready, strip down your houses
Cause I'm stepping out, stepping out, stepping out

I used to believe everything I read (x3)
But that's all changed 'cause now I'm stepping out
That's all changed cause now I'm
stepping out (x3)

Stepping out (x4)


LAST ORDERS 

Everybody's telling me to listen up
They're trying to run my life for me
I'm gonna tell I'll tell 'em
Their term's up

(Chorus)
They've just given me their
Last orders (x4)

Everyone's in prison or in the army
All sincere, all phoney
Reading all the books, taking in the news
(Chorus)

I don't dig their dead-end options
I'm not hurt by their rejections
I'm no sell-out, and they've found out
(Chorus)

Everybody's telling me to listen up
They're trying to write my life story
Joke's on them
It's the end of the rap
(Chorus)

FRIGHTENED 

Someone's always on my tracks
In a dark room you see more than you think
I'm out of my place, got to get back
I sweated a lot, you could feel the violence


I've got shears pointed straight at my chest
And time moves slow when you count it
I'm better than them, and I think I'm the best
But I'll appear at midnight when the films close


Cause I'm in a trance
and I sweat
I don't want to dance
I want to go home.


I couldn't live in those peephole places
They might get to know my actions
I'd run away from toilets and faeces
I'd run away to a non-date on the street


Cause I'm in a trance
and I sweat
I don't want to dance
I want to go home.


I feel trapped by mutual affection
And I don't know how to use freedom
I spend hours looking sideways
to the time when I was sixteen


Cause I'm in a trance.


I'm frightened.
Amphetamine frightened


I go to the top of the street
I go to the bottom of the street
I look to the sky, my lips are dry....



CRAP RAP 2/LIKE TO BLOW 

We are the Fall
Northern white crap that talks back
We are not black. Tall.
No boxes for us.
Do not fuck us.
We are frigid stars.
We were spitting, we were snapping "Cop Out, Cop Out!"
as if from heaven.


Sucker X 9


No stars in the zone
I stay at home
I live on snacks
Potatoes in packs


I like to blow...
I like to blow....
I like to blow
Concentration zone


The years go in circles,
the years go in circles
Hopes goes, I'm gone
Smoke comes, i go


A spurs fan, a warrior,
happy no-hoper
Dull, manage,
I think slow.


Sucker, blow.



REBELLIOUS JUKEBOX 

I'm searching for the now
I'm looking for the real thing, yeah


Head through a blue haze
Waiting for the musical craze
We gotta taxi for Mr. Nelson
Taxi for Mr. Nelson


Rebellious Jukebox yeah
Rebellious Jukebox, oh


No sounds at first came out
This machine had dropped out
But it made music to itself
Made music for itself


Rebellious Jukebox yeah
Rebellious Jukebox now


I'm looking for the home of the real
I want a happy time now

Drinkers from the slaughterhouse
Weren't happy and went out
Noise resounds aloud
Noise resounds the lounge


Rebellious Jukebox yeah
Rebellious Jukebox oh


I sidled up to a fruit machine
This I was imagining:
Some drinkers dancing at the bar
Drinkers dancing for the bar


Rebellious Jukebox yeah
Rebellious Jukebox now


I'm searching for the now
I'm looking for the real thing yeah



NO XMAS FOR JOHN QUAYS 

The x in x-mas is a substitute crucifix for Christ
No Christmas for John Quays


The powders reach
And the powders teach
And when you find they can't reach
There is no Christmas for junky


He thinks he is
More interesting
Than the world
But buying cigs
Puts him in a whirl


A packet of three-five fives
555
A packet of those over there
And 20 special offer cigars


Found talking to the cigarette machine
Into nicotinic acid
Good king Wenceslaus, he looked out
Silly bugger, he fell out


He spits in the sky
It falls in his eye
Then he gets to sit in
Talking to his kitten

And talking about Frankie Lymon

Tell me why is it so?
Tell me why is it so?

Out of his face with The Idle Race
Out of the room with his tune


Although the skins are thin
He knows its up to him
To go out or stay in


I'll stay in
I'll stay in


You
Me
X-Mas
X-Mas


There is no Christmas for junkies
No girls
No curls
Just the traffic passing by
Bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye
1,2,3,4


No X-mas for John Quays



MOTHER - SISTER! 

Er, what's this song about?
Er, nothing.


None
No recipes
It was like a see-saw
No
It was like an up and down
Bye bye
Mother, Sister
Mother, Sister
Why did you put your head in?


Reach or preach
It's all a diminished return
Now
Floorboard
Creaks


Mother, Sister
Mother, Sister
Why did you push your head in?


Astray
Our Friends
And the fathers are underground
Your mouth is sold out


Mother, Sister
Mother, Sister
Why did you put your head in?


The pylon



INDUSTIAL ESTATE 

Get off the Ind. Est.
Get off the Ind. Est.


Yeah, Yeah, Industrial Estate
Yeah, Yeah, Industrial Estate
Yeah, Yeah, Industrial Estate


Well you started here to earn your pay
Clean neck and ears on your first day
Well we tap one another as you walk in the gate
And we'd build a canteen but we haven't got much space


Yeah, Yeah, Industrial Estate
And the crap in the air will fuck up your face
Yeah, Yeah, Industrial Estate
Boss can bloody take most of your wage
And if you get a bit of depression
Ask the doctor for some valium


Yeah, Yeah, Industrial Estate
Yeah, Yeah, Industrial Estate
Yeah, Yeah, Industrial Estate



UNDERGROUND MEDECIN 

(Your nervous system, your nervous system)
(Underground medicine, underground medicine)


A spark inside
[Traverse up my hide]
And when it clicks
There's no resist


Every time I hear a new baby cry
I thank my spark inside


And you get underground medicine
Underground medicine
I'm but a nervous system
Underground medicine


I found a reason not to die
A reason for the ride
The spark inside
When it hits the mind you get
Underground medicine
Underground medicine
I'm but a nervous system
Underground medicine


I had a psychosomatic voice
And one time it might come back


Underground medicine
Underground medicine
I'm but a nervous system
Underground medicine


On my pants I spilled expectorant
And the colonel shot better with 30 pints
They took his cup away
Take it away, take it away
[Used to 'ground] medicine
[Used to 'ground] medicine
[Used to 'ground] medicine



TWO STEPS BACK 

Everybody likes me
They think I'm crazy
Pull my string and I do my thing.


Two Steps Back


I don't need the acid factories
I've got mushrooms in the fields
Julian said "How was the gear?"[1]
They don't sell things to you over there
A cigarette goes out when you put it down.


Two Steps Back


Had a look at the free festivals
They're like cinemas with no films
You could make a fire with the seats
You could boil up some cigar [cig-ah!] dimps
Or get into the sound
Wait for the ice cream to come around.


Two Steps Back
Two Doors Down


I meet my old friends there
They queue up for cash there
They are part Irish
They have no conscience
They get threatened by the cracker factory.


Two Steps Back


Cracker Factory:
A place where you get into the working routine again.
Rehabs for no hopes
Prefab for jobless dopes.

LIVE AT THE WITCH TRIALS 

We're still one step ahead of you
I still believe in the R and R dream
R and R as primal scream

Tied to the Puritan Ethic
Nonsympathetic to spastics
After all this, still a lonely bastard.

Eggheads, boneheads, queue
Queue for them
We were early and we were late
But, still, live at the witch trials....


FUTURES AND PASTS 

I was in a sleeping dream
When a policeman brought my mother home
By the window I didn't scream
I was too old for that

I was in a drunken dream
The pubs were closed
It was three o'clock
At the bottom of the street it seemed
There was a policeman lost in the fog

I understand but I don't see it
I understand but I don't see it
I understand but I don't read it
Futures and Pasts

You can cry for your lost childhood
Will you cry for our lost childhoods?
But remember how you hated it
And worse cause you couldn't state it?

And it's time for the note, see it
And it's time for the note, say it
And it's time for the note, read it
Futures and Pasts

Look at the woman of thirty-nine
Look at the man of forty-nine
You can read their lousy lives
You can see their ugly face lines

They understand but they don't see it
They understand but they don't see it
I understand but I don't read it
Futures and Pasts

I understand but I don't see it
I understand but I don't see it
I understand but I don't read it
Futures and Pasts


MUSIC SCENE 

Oh aye you're a good lad
Here is a pound note
The stupid bitch
They were made for each other


You should have met his brother
His mother was deaf and dumb


Well that stupid get
Played games with names
Of the place he'd worked
Of the women he tupped


He thought he were envy of the music scene
Part of the choosy scene
Envy of the music scene


Here comes long hair for the fair
No pay just take on the way
Those bastards stripped me bare
In front of all those people


Spat peanuts in my hair
And all the leaves are brown


And be part of the music scene
Envy of the choosy scene
Part of the music scene


And aye you're a good lad
Oh here is a new flat
That stupid twat
Made for each other


You should have met his brothers
Real [fuckers]
That stupid kid
Played games with names
All the gigs he'd worked
And the women he'd fucked


He was part of the music scene
Envy of the choosy set
Part of the music scene


Leave a mark on the city
I'll smash your doors down
Become a demolition worker
A metal construction worker


And behind our conscious minds
Our affections are turning grey


Yeah, we're part of the music scene
Envy of the choosy scene
Part of the music scene


Part of the music scene
Part of the choosy scene


6 minutes!


6:40!


OK, studio, that's plenty

A FIGURE WALKS 

A figure walks behind you
A figure walks behind you
A shadow walks behind you
A figure walks behind you

Days of booze and roses
Shine on us, free us all
Who is not irascible
He is no genius

A figure walks behind you
A figure walks behind you
A shadow walks behind you
A figure walks behind you

The old golden savages
Killed their philosophers
Thought brought the drought about
Something followed me out
Goes out again

A figure walks behind you
A shadow walks behind you
A figure walks behind you
A shadow walks behind you

And if it grabs my coat tail
I will turn and hit it
It may remove the pegs
Keeping my eyes open

A figure walks behind you
A shadow walks behind you
A figure walks behind you
A shadow walks behind you

It's got eyes of brown, watery
Nails of pointed yellow
Hands of black carpet
It's a quick trip to the ice house
A quick trip to the ice house X 3

A figure walks behind you
A shadow walks behind you
A figure walks behind you
A shadow walks behind you
You X 7

A figure walks behind you
A shadow walks behind you
A figure walks behind you
A shadow walks behind you

You X 3

And tales of terror
Which my father told me
They never scared me
But not only is it the blind
Who cannot see
That figure behind you
Behind you x 2
You x 2

That figure kept on walking
Behind you

There's a man on my trail X 4
He's also behind you
Behind you X 4

That figure kept on walking X 4
Behind you X3

A figure walks 3


PRINTHEAD 

Hey badges tinkle
T-shirts mingle

Hey you horror-face!

I'm a printhead
I go to pieces
I'm a printhead
I go to pieces yeah

End of catch-line
End of hook-line

We had a two page
It's what we needed
I'm an ill head
My face increases
How my head increases
Real problems, biz

So how is it, yeah
That I've reached here
I thought this game
Would do me good

How could printed vinyl bring you out to here?

We laughed with them
When it was take-the-piss time
I'm no egghead
But I'm an ex-worker man
W.C.-hero friend - and not water closet!

There's a barrier between writer and singer
Uh-huh he's a good man
Although a lazy one
The singer is a neurotic drinker
The band little more than a big crashing beat.
Instruments collide and we all get drunk

The last two lines
Were a quote, yeah
When we read them
We went to pieces

We went to pieces, yeah
We went to pieces, yeah
Regularly

One day a week
I'm a printhead, yeah
Twenty pence a week
Dirty fingers

Printhead X 3

With print you substitute an ear
For an extra useless eye


DICE MAN 

I am the dice man
And I take a chance, huh
Do you take a chance, huh?

But I wanna read a horror story

But I am the dice man
A balls-on-the-line man
Do you take a chance, baby?

BEFORE THE MOON FALLS 

Shhhh

We are private detectives onward back from a musical pilgrimage
We work under the name of the Fall.
Who would suspect this?
It is too obvious.
Our office is secluded.
Those there to suspect
Would not see the wood for the trees
We were six like dice but we're back to five
Up here in the North there are no wage packet jobs for us
Thank Christ
While young married couples discuss the poverties
Of their self-built traps
And the junior clergy demand more cash
We spit in their plate and wait for the ice to melt

I must create a new regime
Or live by another man's
Before the moon falls
I must create a new scheme
And get out of others' hands
Before the moon falls

I could use some pure criminals
And get my hands on some royalties
Before the moon falls

A problem of this new scheme
Is answering obscene phone calls
Before the moon falls

Gotta stop drifting around
Kill this ugly duckling
We've got the power
And must not misuse it
Cos life is short and full of thought
I use the power

And will forever end this reign of terror
Before the moon falls
Before the tide subsides
Before the moon falls for the fifth time
Before The Fall swoons


YOUR HEART OUT 

Just take for instance
a time of great depression
Fade out of reason
bad time's in season

Don't shut your heart out
Don't cry your eyes out

Don't cry for me, Mexico
Or Savage Pencil
I'm nearly healthy

And they try to take my eyes out
Friends try to work my soul out
But I don't sing, I just shout
Heavy clout, heart out

Now here's a joke
to cheer you up:
Old times no surgeon
Just magicians and dungeons
There they take your heart out
with a sharp knife
It wasn't fake
They had no anesthetic.
That joke's pathetic.

Just look at me
Too much speed
But very plain
You're lucky, friend.

You've got one to take out
You know what I'm talking about!
I don't sing I just shout
All on one note.
Sing, sing, sing, sing
Look at me, I just ding

Heart is out, out, it's out

FLAT OF ANGLES 

Dragnet for gun-blast man
The papers had a father
Holding up a picture
His son-in-law killed her

Yes he killed his wife
She was wasting his life
His veins are full of evil serum
But what's done is done

Now he's trapped in flat of Angles
Hiding in flat of Angles
Right down to its gables

And sometimes bell bust under
The rings from many callers
Coupon and gas-board man
Dragnet for gun-blast man

Who's trapped in flat of Angles
Rented cage is flat of Angles
Right down to its gables

And first he started on the floorboards
120 degrees from window
Doors open to specification
And keeps out stupid neighbours

Very safe is flat of Angles
Cheap rent too his flat of Angles
Down to its gables

Here he fights to type
Story of murder in his life
Or soap operas all day
In rooms of dirty laundry

But I'm in flat of Angles
Hiding in flat of Angles
Right down to its gables

And the sun dragged him out one day
From his laundry
He saw mercenary eyes
The streets are full of mercenary eyes

Well stretched in flat of Angles
Not long left in flat of Angles
Down to the gables

There's a big reward for gun-blast man
A big reward for gun-blast man
A big reward for gun-blast man

Let us go up and [..] write stories

Dragnet

Phone in for the Dragnet man

SPECTRE VS. RECTOR 

MR James be born be born
Yog Sothoth rape me lord
Sludge hai choi [blah blah]

MR James be born be born
Yog Sothoth rape me lord
Van Greenway [blah blah]
Sludge hai choi [blah blah]

Part one: spectre versus rector
The rector lived in Hampshire
The spectre was from Chorazina
Inevil dust in the air
The rector locked his doors

Part two: detective drives through Hampshire
Stops because of the fog there
And thinks a visit to the rector
And meanwhile and meanwhile

Spectre possesses rector
Rector becomes spectre
Sludge hai choi [blah blah]
Sludge hai choi [blah blah]
Enter inspector
Even as he spoke a dust devil suddenly arose and struck him

Part four: detective versus rector
Detective versus rector possessed by spectre
Spectre blows him against the wall
Says "Die latin this is your fall
I've waited since Caesar for this
Damn Latin my hate is crisp
I'll rip your fat body to pieces

MR James be born be born
Yog Sothoth rape me lord
Van Greenway [blah blab]

Scene five, scene five
Comes a hero
Soul possessed a thousand times
Only he could rescue rector
Only he could save inspector
And this hero was a strange man
"Those flowers, take them away" he said
"They're only funeral decorations
And oh this is a drudge nation
A nation of no imagination
A stupid man is their ideal
They shun me and think me unclean,
unclean"

I have saved a thousand souls
They cannot even save their own
I'm soaked in blood but always good
It's like I drunk myself sober
I get better as I get older
MR James be born be born
Yog Sothoth rape me lord
Van Greenway [blah blah]
Sludge hai choi [blah blah]
Sludge hai choi [blah blah]

Part six:
That was his kick from life
That's how he pads out his life
Selling his soul to the devil
And the spectre enters hero
But the possession is ineffectual
But the possession is ineffectual
And the possession is ineffectual

And MR James be born be born
Yog Sothoth rape me lord
Van Greenway [blah blah]
Sludge hai choi [blah blah]
Sludge hai choi [blah blah]
I said Sludge hai choi [blah blah]

Last scene:
Hero and inspector walk from the scene
Is the spectre banished forever?
The inspector is half insane
The hero runs back into the mountains
The hero goes back into the mountains
He was an exorcist but he was exhausted
An exorcist but he was exhausted
He racked on his bed all night long

MR James be born be born
Yog Sothoth rape me lord
Van Greenway [blah blah]
Sludge hai choi [blah blah]
Sludge hai choi [blah blah]

[chorus ad lib]

Note: M.R. James was a 19th Century ghost story writer. Yog Sogoth is a character in H.P. Lovecraft's horror stories. Demon possession is a common theme in Fall songs - see Lay Of The Land, Impression Of J Temperance, Jaw Bone And The Air Rifle, Elves, Bug Day


PUT AWAY 

Ba da ba da ba da ba daaa!
Late 20th Century was late and just said yes or no
And was mistaken for sarcasm, even belligerent
Now to fight!

They're putting me away but I'll be back someday
Putting me away but I'll be back someday
Prisoner for a year and a day
Putting me away but I'll be back someday

A bust doorbell sound and the door broken down
A doorbell sound and the door broken down
They rang and rang but I never went down
And now they're putting me away but I'll be back someday
Putting me away but I'll be boo ba ba boo ba ba bow..
Verse second

[Peel session:
I thought I would follow a friend
Red banner, split end
Follow a friend or some local men
I used to drink a bottle of vodka a day]

They rang and rang but I never went down
People ring I never go down
All metal walls now I'm sent down
And they're putting me away but I'll be back someday
Putting me away but I'll be back someday

And my night sight's gone but it won't be long
I see see long now it's gone
Just two girls and a millionaire
And they're putting me away but I'll be back someday

Putting me away but I'll be boo ba ba.......
Put the heat on

Putting me away

No sex or records for a year and a day
They're putting me away

I've been bunged up, I've been banged up
I've been moved up, I've been banged up
I said ba da ba da ba da badaaaaa


We are Northern white crap that talks back 
We are The Fall we were spinning we were stepping
Cop out, cop out as in from heaven 
The difference between you and us is that we have brains
Cos we are Northern white crap 
But we talk back 
Uh oh, uh oh 
Bang fucking bang, The Mighty Fall 
The Fall, we are back, we are back 
And this next number is Fiery Jack


FIERY JACK 

My face is slack
And the kidneys burn
In the small of my back
Will never learn 
Well I'm not going back
To the slow life 
Cos every step is a drag
And peace is a kite 
Of materials you never catch
Come up for a snatch 
Up from hell 
Once in a while

Cause I am Jack 
From a burning ring 
My face is slack
And I think think think
I just think think think
Too fast to write 
Too fast to work 
Just burn burn burn

I sat and drank 
For three decades 
I'm 45 
Cause I am Jack 
From a burning ring
And my face is slack
And I think think think
I just drink drink drink
Too fast to write 
Too fast to work 
I just burn burn burn

A store man from the slack 
They are smart 
They are [mod] 
Their brains are half 
They never end 
Just follow trends

But I am Jack ...

And put down left-wing tirades
And the musical trades 
And all free trade 
I said eat this grenade

Cause I am Jack 
From the burning ring
My face is slack 
And I think think think
Just think think think 
Too fast to work 
Too fast to write 
I just burn burn burn

And put down left-wing tirades
and the musical trades 
And all free trade 
I said eat this grenade 
I said Doncaster eat this grenade


ROWCHE RUMBLE 

[spoken/announced] Last orders half past ten

This is a groovy number ah!
Rowche Rumble 
Is valium 
Valium 
Valium 
Rowche Rumble 
I said rumble

Loads of wives around the world
are given them by doctors, who think they're little girls
The doctors need prescriptions 
The wives need their pills 
So Rowche Rumble

Menopause wives are hard to handle
No culture or love, no gambles 
The [dull] manage, especially smashed
on Rowche Rumble 
Rowche Rumble

Physician, heal thyself
Why don't you heal yourself?
The promoter is a jerk 
The promoter is a jerk

Our government's built on expense accounts
Once in, never out 
A step to Rowche 
Force feeding 
What are the people around you taking? 
Rowche Rumble

Physician heal thyself
Why don't you heal yourselves?

Now I've tried crazy things
Abusing my body to a quick end
But I'll never never never never do it again
I said I'll never never never never do it again
Rowche Rumble

Musician, heal thyself.

Loads of people across the land
Do a prescribed death dance 
While condemning speed and grass
They got an addiction like a hole in the ass
For Rowche Rumble 
Rowche Rumble

Physician heal thyself
Why don't you heal yourselves?
Rowche Rumble

I send 70 pounds instead of 70 p to
pharmaceutical company Rowche AG 
The lorry arrived the next day 
Swiss gnomes dealing out potions 
They're gonna kick your liver in 
You gotta treat it like a bin 
Beer and speed is okay 
But the full use of your body isn't

Rowche Rumble
It's valium 
Said rumble

IN MY AREA 

In my
A dwarf plays pool to prove his height
People play games when they lose in life
There's no sport life, just acid tension stomach flash.
The madness in my area

I have seen the birth of bad
I have seen declining tracks
I have seen the madness in my area

I understand time till I'm asked about it
Days cross-check, years become a tick 
Can't remember who I sacked, just stupid faces looking back
The madness in my area

I have seen the birth of bad
I have seen declining tracks
I have seen the madness in my area

And former friends suck on the Fall
Genuine white crap article 
Your future cries of broken pain 
Are idiot victims 
Just adds to the madness in my area

I have seen the wooo woooo
I have seen declining tracks
I have seen the madness in my area

You've got comic fools in full bloom
McCarthy reincarnate soon 
See the bones of the two-late faces 
The me generation 
See the traces of 
The madness in my area

I have seen the birth of bad
I have seen declining tracks
I have seen the madness in my area

I have seen the madness in my area
In the writer 
In the fighter 
In the mirror 
In the '77 shit pile 
The doppelganger 
The new satire [boozed satyr?]

Blood and sand
Your highs are contrived
The bands are getting too contrived, recent
Your audience is not even decent

SPECTRE VS. RECTOR 2 

Those flowers, take them away
They're only funeral decoration
This is The Fall and this is the drudge nation
Your decadent sins will reap discipline
New puritan

You shook me
I wash every day but still it's
But still it's unclean unclean

I have saved a thousand souls
You cannot even save your own
I'm soaked in blood but always good

I get better as I get older

CARY GRANT'S WEDDING 

I said shut up
Everybody go Cary Grant's wedding

Champagne hip hip hooray
Thank you folks for coming today
How much was the price of the Dodge?
Sure it's worth a whole lot more

I said go to Cary Grant's wedding
All you folks and fools 
Cary Grant's Wedding

All you folks and fools
Have been invited to 
A new-wave personality 
Stumbles out of the ruins
Cos he's been invited to 
Cary Grant's wedding

Buster Keaton he turned up
He wasn't a woman 
He didn't take hallucigens

A poor mate for Cary Grant
Slaughterer of innocents 
Add on 30 years 
And you've got Jake Burns 
Joe Strummer

All you're going to
Cary Grant's wedding
A new-wave Hollywood
Where everybody's good
But not great

Cary Grant's wedding


THAT MAN 

That man loves you
That man cares for you
That man loves a heathen
That man loves you

He came down from Accrington
He came down from Hovis land

And

He washed the dirt from my eyes
All devils are exorcised 
And sticky pants are ostracised
Sermons with trad jazz guys

Screaming

That man loves you
That man cares for you
That man loves a heathen
That man loves you

You see, can't be holy
All you see can't be holy
All you see can't be holy
[backing vocals] That man loves you

And all decadent sins

A pterodactyl cackle 
Jet plane circle 
Over imported trees 
All the film ghosts will rise up 
With the sexually abused and the new youth

In Britain the scream of electric pumps in a renovated pub
Your stomach swells up before you get drunk 
Don't call me Peter I can't go 
Salem's just up the road 
I've got work to do

The grotesque peasants stalk the land
And deep down inside you know everybody wants to like big companies

Male slags, male slates, famous apes

Echoes of the past

All hail the new puritan

New puritan
New puritan

The conventional is now experimental
The experimental is now conventional
It's a dinosaur cackle
A pteradactyl cackle
In LA a drunk is sick on Gene Vincent's star on Hollywood Boulevard
Ha-ha ha-ha
Stripping takes off in Britain's black spots
The Kensington white rastas run for cabs
This I have seen

New puritan

In Britain the scream of electric pumps in a renovated pub
Your stomach swells up before you get drunk
The bars are full of male slags
At 10:35 they play "Send in the Clowns" once

Why don't you ask your local record dealer how many bribes he took today?
What do you mean "What's it mean? What's it mean?"?
"What's it mean? What's it mean?"

NO XMAS FOR JOHN QUAYS 

No Christmas for John Quays
Come on get a bit of fucking guts into it
What what

Well the powders reach you
And the powders teach you 
But when you find they can't reach you
There is no Christmas for junky

He thinks he is
More interesting
Than the world

Ah but buying fags 
Puts him in a whirl

I'll have a packet of three-five fives
Will you fucking put the monitors on for Christ's sake?
I'll have a packet of three-five fives 
I'll have 20 of those over there 
I'll have 20 No.6 for a headache 
And I've had enough right there, stop

(Why is this)
Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah

He spits in the sky
It falls in his eye
And then he gets to sitting
Talking to his kitten 
Talking about Frankie Lymon

Tell me why is it so?
Tell me why is it so?

Why did the sky break today?
Why did this happen today?

He goes out of his face with the Idle Race
He goes out of the room with this tune

Although the skins are thin
He knows its up to him 
To go out or stay in

I'll stay in
I'll stay in
Have a break

You
Me 
X-Mas
X-Mas

Well the powders reach you
And the powders teach you 
But when you find they can't reach you
There is no Christmas for junky 
There is no girls 
There is no curls
Just the traffic passing by 
Bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye

Open the room, there's a cloud of smoke 
Will you fucking get it together instead of showing off?

Give me one
Give me B 
Give me three
Give me D

No X-mas for John Quays

ENGLISH SCHEME 

O'er grassy dale, and lowland scene
Come see, come hear, the English Scheme.
The lower-class, want brass, bad chests, scrounge fags.
The clever ones tend to emigrate
Like your psychotic big brother, who left home
For jobs in Holland, Munich, Rome
He's thick but he struck it rich, switch
The commune crap, camp bop, middle-class, flip-flop
Guess that's why they end up in bands
He's the green piece in us all
He's the creep-creep in us all
Condescends to black men
Very nice to them
They talk of Chile while driving through Haslingden
You got sixty hour weeks, and stone stone toilet back-gardens
Peter Cook's jokes, bad dope, check shirts, lousy groups
Point their fingers at America
Down pokey quaint streets in Cambridge
Cycles our distant spastic heritage
Its a gay red, roundhead, army career, grim head
If we was smart we'd emigrate



NEW FACE IN HELL 

Wireless enthusiast intercepts government secret radio band and
uncovers secrets and scandals of deceitful type proportions.

Aghast goes next door to his neighbor, secretly excited, as
aforementioned was a hunter whom radio enthusiast wanted
friendship and favor of.

A new face in hell

Nearly a new face in hell!

A muscular, thick-skinned, slit-eyed neighbor is at the table
poisoned just thirty seconds before by parties who knew of
wireless operator's forthcoming revelation.

A new face in hell!

A prickly line of sweat covers enthusiast's forehead as the
realization hits him that the same government him and his now
dead neighbor voted for and backed and talked of on cream porches
have tricked him into their war against the people who enthusiast
and dead hunter would have wished torture on. A servant of
government walks in and arrests wireless fan in
kitchen for murder of his neighbor

A new face in hell!

The dead cannot contradict
Sometimes the living cannot

A new face in hell!

Then was America
We went there
Big A&M Herb was there [2]
His offices had fresh air
But his roster was mediocre
US dirge, rock 'n' pop filth
Their material's filched
And the secret of their lives
Is...

All the English groups
Act like peasants with free milk
On a route
On a route to the loot
To candy mountain
Five wacky English proletariat idiots
Californians always think of sex
Or think of death
Five hundred girl deaths
A Mexico revenge, it's stolen land
They really get it off on
"Don't hurt me please"
Rapist fill the TVs
And the secret of their lives
Is S.E.X..

I have dreams, I can see
Carloads of negro Nazis
Like Faust with beards
Hydrochloric shaved weirds

[Applause from audience at Cyprus Tavern ]

This was going to be called crap rap fourteen,
but it's now Stop Mithering.
The things that drain you off and drive you off the hinge.
Boils, dirty socks, the ceilings collapse.
The Sunday morning loud lawn mower,
the upstairs Jewish girl damn hoovering every thirty minutes, 
from valium cig withdrawal.
She wants communal, fluent flat household.
I want privacy.
The bastard dentist doctors surgery,
Clip, clop, ring, knock, ring
Stop mithering [3]

The estates stick up like stacks
The estates stick up like stacks
The residents keep wild dogs
And on that father's bedroom closet top,
electric blanket boxes
Surplus jonnies, demob pictures
To their children they sing
Stop mithering

You think you've got it bad with thin ties,
miserable songs synthesized, or circles with A in the middle.
Make joke records, hang out with Gary Bushell,
Join round table. "I like your single yer great!"
A circle of low IQ's.
There are three rules of audience.
My journalist acquaintances, go soft, go places,
on record company expenses.
I lose humor, manners become bog writers, don't know it.
The smart hedonists, same as last verse, allusions with
H in electronics, on stage false histrionics,
Corpse mauling dicks, pose through a good film, him, him
Stop mithering

I'm not joining conventional rock band.
The conventional is experimental, the conventional is now
experimental,
And is no way noble, and I'm no chock stock thing.
So stop mithering.
Engineers save up for cars.
I try to let down their tyres with matches to make them molten.
Ouch! Ouch!
They say I rip off Johnny Rotten
They always strike for more pay.
They say "See yer mate..Yeh...see yer mate"
To their mothers they sing
Stop mithering

He even did fail the penile tissue test.
He hangs out for sex.
He enters magazine contest.
White tan horror in the mirror.
Spotty exterior hides a spotty interior.
He's not your enemy.
He's not your enemy, his name is not Harry.
The secret of Cash and Carry.

CASH 'N' CARRY 

Three months. Three days. Three months. Cliches. Cliches. A

THE CONTAINER DRIVERS 

Net cap. of 58 thousand pounds
They sweat on their way down 
Grey ports with customs bastards 
Hang around like clowns the 
Uh-containers and their drivers

Bad indigestion
Bad bowel retention
Speed for their wages
Suntan, torn short sleeves

Look at a car park for two days
Look at a grey port for two days
Train line, stone and grey

This is not their town
Big cigars come out of the ground
Sweat on their way down 
F. Jack's a distant relation 
Communists are just part time workers
And there's no thanks 
From the loading bay ranks

Look at a car park for two days
Look at a grey port for two days
Train line, stone and grey 
RO-RO roll on roll off 
The container drivers 
Speed for their wages 
Uh-containers 
Uh-and their drivers


IMPRESSION OF J. TEMPERANCE 

Hate wide for dog breeder
in the town of purport
A never seen dog breeder
This is the tale of his replica.


Name was J. Temperance
Only two did not hate him
Because peasants fear local indifference
Pet shop and the vet, Cameron.


One night vet is called out
from his overpaid leisure
To Temperance household, delivered ran out
and phoned his wife in terror.


The next bit is hard to relate.
(There are no read-outs for this part of the track.)
The new born thing hard to describe
Like a rat that's been trapped inside
A warehouse base, near a city tide
Brown sockets, purple eyes
And fed with rubbish from disposal barges brown and covered

No changeling,
as the birth was witnessed.
Only one person could do this:
"Yes" said Cameron
"and the thing was in the
impression of J. Temperance."


His hideous replica.
Scrutinise the little monster
Disappeared through the door
His hideous replica


IN THE PARK 

Night though I do not sleep
I dream of the park up the road
I open the bushes, a couple of lovers
Trying to be [lust-rockers]
And although my spouse is in the other room
I think we can do it here
Yes, uh, and she makes me pay
For every girl I have the guts to look at
Anyway here, quiet here
You thought it'd be great
You thought it'd be great
But a good mind does not a good fuck make


I take you to the park up the road
But here is the rain
Rain makes policemen no threat
Turns cars into little specks
Muffles the shouts of your neighbour
And we will have sex here
Here, here
Couch, shagged out
There's no hard-ons
It's just come and it's gone


I'm becoming everything I used to hate
But I can't go back there
Not back there, I can't go back there
Not back to the park
The brown monk ghost'll catch us
And make us lust-rockers
Make us wear huckleberry masks and, uh, huckleberry masks
You sing you don't believe in [couples]
But I can't believe that
Especially the crap about the huckleberry masks


W.M.C. - BLOB 59 

Right we'll go here
Where is he?
Just been to the park
Not the pub, the park
Go on

We too do not recognise the M.U. 
We come with our hands open in fiendship
We can lead you to proletariat visions of prosperity
WMC!
[The social alternative was incredibly frequent]


We come with our hands open in fiendship
We can lead you to proletariat visions of prosperity
We merely make cabaret
We are on Gramme Friday


GRAMME FRIDAY 

The people I like live
in kitchens and halls.


I can't reach a decision on this.
Can I come back to you on this?
Hitler lost his nerve on it.
Dr. Morel prescribed it well
It's fast debts.


I am Robertson Speedo
and this is my Gramme Friday.
Skin drops slow to the bones


But I've got my hunger anyway.
I'm on Gramme Friday.
Work and eat spontaneous
Enter the house of weariness.
It's Fastnet


Look out
Look down
Look out
Look now
The hunger....
Friday .



THE N.W.R.A. 

When it happened we walked through all the estates, from
Manchester right to, er, Newcastle. In Darlington, helped a large
man on his own chase off some kids who were chucking bricks and
stuff through his flat window. She had a way with people like that. 
Thanked us and we moved on.


'Junior Choice' played one morning. The song was 'English
Scheme.' Mine. They'd changed it with a grand piano and turned
it into a love song. How they did it I don't know. DJs had
worsened since the rising. Elaborating on nothing in praise of
the track with words they could hardly pronounce, in telephone
voices.


I was mad, and laughed at the same time. The West German
government had brought over large yellow trains on Teeside docks.
In Edinburgh. I stayed on my own for a few days, wandering about
in the, er, pissing rain, before the Queen Mother hit town.


I'm Joe Totale
The yet unborn son
The North will rise again
The North will rise again
Not in 10,000 years
Too many people cower to criminals
And government crap
The estates stick up like stacks
The North will rise again X4
Look where you are
Look where you are
The future death of my father


Shift!


Tony was a business friend
Of RT XVII
And was an opportunist man
Come, come hear my story
How he set out to corrupt and destroy
This future Rising


The business friend came round today
With teeth clenched, he grabbed my neck
I threw him to the ground
His blue shirt stained red
The north will rise again.
He said you are mistaken, friend
I kicked him out of the home


Too many people cower to criminals
And that government pap
When all it takes is hard slap


But out the window burned the roads
There were men with besom sticks [1]
The fall had made them sick
A man with butterflies on his face
His brother threw acid in his face
His tatoos were screwed
The streets of Soho did reverberate
With drunken Highland men
Revenge for Culloden dead
The North had rose again
But it would turn out wrong
The North will rise again


So R. Totale dwells underground
Away from sickly grind
With ostrich head-dress
Face a mess, covered in feathers
Orange-red with blue-black lines
That draped down to his chest
Body are a tentacle mess
And light blue plant-heads
TV showed Sam Chippendale
No conception of what he'd made
The Arndale had been razed
Shop staff knocked off their ladders
Security guards hung from moving escalators


And now that is said
Tony seized the control
He built his base in Edinburgh
Had on his hotel wall
A hooded friar on a tractor
He took a bluey and he called Totale
Who said, "the North has rose again"
But it will turn out wrong


When I was in cabaret
I vowed to defend
All of the English clergy
Though they have done wrong
And the fall has begun
This has got out of hand
I will go for foreign aid
But he Tony, laughed down the phone
Said "Totale go back to bed"
The North has rose today
And you can stuff your aid!
And you can stuff your aid!

Note: [1] A besom is a long handled broom with the head made out of pieces of twig lashed together.


HOW I WROTE 'ELASTIC MAN' 

I'm eternally grateful
To my past influences
But they will not free me
I am not diseased
All the people ask me
How I wrote "Elastic Man"


Life should be full of strangeness
Like a rich painting
But it gets worse day by day
I'm a potential DJ
A creeping wreck
A mental wretch
Everybody asks me
How I wrote "Elastic Man"


His soul hurts though it's well filled up
The praise received is mentally sent back
Or taken apart
The Observer magazine just about sums him up
E.g. self-satisfied, smug


I'm living a fake
People say, "You are entitled to and great."
But I haven't wrote for 90 days
I'll get a good deal and I'll go away
Away from the empty brains that ask
How I wrote "Elastic Man"


His last work was "Space Mystery" in the Daily Mail,
An article in Leather Thighs
The only thing real is waking and rubbing your eyes
So I'm resigned to bed
I keep bottles and comics stuffed by its head
Fuck it, let the beard grow
I'm too tired,
I'll do it tomorrow
The fridge is sparse
But in the town
They'll stop me in the shoppes
Verily they'll track me down
Touch my shoulder and ignore my dumb mission
And sick red faced smile
And they will ask me
And they will ask me
How I wrote "Elastic Man"


CITY HOBGOBLINS 

Spiders know these things 
Gremlins know these things
Tap, tap, tap, tap
You think it's the pipes
But who turns on the lights?
Our city hobgoblins
Ubu le Roi is a home hobgoblin
And at nights all ready
Our city hobgoblins
Infest my home at night
They are not alright
Ten times my age
One-tenth my height
Our city hobgoblins
Buzz of the all-night mill
Ah but evil
Emigres from old green glades
Pretentious eh?
Our city hobgoblins
They'll get yer
So Queen Victoria
Is a large black slug in Piccadilly, Manchester
Our city hobgoblins
And they say
We cannot walk the floor at night in peace
At night in peace

PUTTA BLOCK 

What a dynamic entrance


Put a block on the words
This I hear on a train
We had salmon on a bus
At Epsom no races lost
We don't bet we just take ['tec]


Put a block on the words
Got no check on the world
Go and put a block on the works
Listen boys and girls
Just closer
On the [clommererds]
Just close off the words
Put a block on the words


The nine unknown men knew this
Three sorts
The first: along Louie's life
The second: the complete restructure of your pretentious life
Three: the only reason you know this
Is that it was well documented
But I say


Put a block on the words


Here's an independent chart moneyspinner
For all you people who've come a long way
Me and the guys played this for charity for spastics
We played it 10000 times
And raised 5 shillings and 7 and a half pence for charity


Cary Grant's wedding
Hail new puritan, righteous maelstrom
Have you ever heard a Bill Haley LP
What is this shit?
Everybody go Cary Grant's wedding




SLATES

Middle Mass - An Older Lover etc. - Prole Art Threat - Fit And Working Again - Slates, Slags etc. - Leave The Capitol
 

MIDDLE MASS 

The evil is not in extremes
It's in the aftermath
The middle mass
After the fact
Vulturous in the aftermath

Summer close season
A quiet dope and cider man
But during the season
Hard drug and cider mates

The boy is like a tape loop
The boy is like a uh-uh

Not much contact
Drinking, the men wait
They are set at nought
Because cripple states a holy state
Because cripple states a holy state
The Werhmacht never got in here
The Werhmacht never got in here
The Werhmacht never got in here
The Werhmacht never got in here
Thought it took us six years
The werhmacht never got in here
And living here you whisper, bub
And living here you whisper, bub!

This boy is like a tape loop
And he has soft mitts
But he's the last domain
Of a very black, back room brain
He learned a word today
The word's misanthropy
And he's running to and from
The cats from tin pan alley
And he's running with and from
The cats from tin pan alley
And going down the alley
Take the cats from the alley
Up to them
The alley's full of cats from tin pan

Come into the back room Brian
And meet
The middle mass
The middle mass
Vulturous in the aftermath
Middle mass

AN OLDER LOVER ETC. 

You'd better take an older lover x 6
You'll soon get tired of her


To take an older lover
Get ready for old stories
Of teenage sex
From the early sixties
Under cover
Behind office desks
Old divorces
Children's faces


You'd better take a younger lover
You'd better take a younger lover
Or take an older lover
You'll soon get tired of her
(She'll shag you out on the table)

Dear girls
Doctor Annabel lies!
Doctor Annabel lies!
Doctor Annabel lies!
You raced before
It's been done
Tripped and stepped on

You'd better take an older lover
You'd better take an older lover
Or take a younger monster
But deserve better

You'd better take a younger lover
You'd better take a younger lover
You'll miss your older lover
Her love was like your Mother's
With added attractions
You'd better take a younger lover x 4
You'd better take an older lover
You'd better take an older lover
You'd better take a younger lover


Doctor Annabel lies!
Doctor Annabel lies!
Doctor Annabel lies!
Doctor Annabel lies!
On the colour page
French fries spread on her face
On the future autolytic enzyme son

FIT AND WORKING AGAIN 

I'm fit and working again
Walk down the road in the sun
I make a path through a forty strong gang


I'm fit and working again
My sick, think I've seen the tail end
I'm fit and working again


I used to hang like a chandelier
My lungs encrusted in blood
But the flex is now cut clear


I'm fit and working, dear
Took me ten years to write this song
I'm fit and working again
I used to think this bog was the domain


Opinion is at most
One stimulus reason
If you've got the most
With the true precis
Analysis is academic
Some thoughts can get nauseous.


Sat opposite a freak on a train
Warts on his head and chin
Boy, was I getting so vain
I saw the recession around Victoria Station


I'm fit and working again
Gimme the sun.
I'm fit and working again


And I feel like Alan Minter [1]
I just ate eight sheets of blotting paper
And I chucked out the Alka Seltzer


Cause I'm fit and working again...
Don't you know that was the tail end.


Note: [1] Alan Minter is a British boxing champion


SLATES, SLAGS ETC. 

Here's the definitive rant
Slates drive me bats
Therefore I say hey slates give us a break
Male slags, slags slates and tapes 
Everything's strained by the States 
They are the grey ones of our state I relate
Male slags....

And slates, break hard, break hardly
Break the slates for Christ's sake 
Male slags... 
Male slags, knock over your drink 
Pay for correct amount spilt 
Male slags... 
Remember slates are always outta date
In the fine light of day they have to face
Well I can't give a definition
The consequences of their plagiarisation
Male slags
With greedy bastard scrubbed hands
Kill jokes join gangs 
Kill the safety in our lands 
Male slags... 
In the cold nearly old ska Jamaican dawn
Dead publisher's sons
Material hardship pawns
The Beat, Wah! Heat 
Male slags... 
(Dog bites the dicks that feeds it) 
Male slags... 
Academic male slags 
Ream off names of books and bands 
Kill cultural interest in our land 
Male slates 
With creaky pants and scrubbed hands

Okay mates
Let's get onto the valley of weights
The valley of weights is the valley 
Where they cast off the weights 
And became trite, uptight 
Deaf and bereft 
A liberty mess 
Female slates 
Make pins of your whims 
Break your balls , suck your thoughts
Rip off bands 
With stuck up hair and new shitty pants
New beatniks with hoop shirts 
Big priest - give us a break 
Help me to fight the slates 
Male slags....

How would you describe the slates?
Don't start improvising for Christ's sake
They are the grey ones of the state I relate
Everythings strained by the states 
The valley of weights 
Okay mates


LEAVE THE CAPITOL 

The tables covered in beer
Showbiz whines, minute detail
Its a hand on the shoulder in Leicester Square
Its vaudeville pub back room dusty pictures of
White frocked girls and music teachers
The beds too clean
The waters poison for the system


Then you know in your brain
LEAVE THE CAPITOL!
EXIT THIS ROMAN SHELL!
Then you know you must leave the capitol
Straight home (x3)
One room, one room
Then you know in your brain
You know in your brain
LEAVE THE CAPITOL!
EXIT THIS ROMAN SHELL!


Then you know you must leave the capitol
Straight home (x3)
Then you know in your brain
You know in your brain
Leave The Capitol!
Then you know you must leave the capitol


It will not drag me down
I will leave this ten times town
I will leave this fucking dump
One room, one room


Hotel maids smile in unison
Then you know in your brain
You know in your brain
LEAVE THE CAPITOL
EXIT THIS ROMAN SHELL
Then you know you must leave the capitol


I laughed at the great God Pan
I didnae, I didnae
I laughed at the great god Pan
I didnae, I didnae, I didnae, I didnae


LEAVE THE CAPTIOL
EXIT THE ROMAN SHELL
Then you know you must leave the capitol


Pan resides in welsh green masquerades
On welsh cat caravans
But the monty
Hides in curtains
Grey blackish cream
All the paintings you recall
All the side stepped cars
All the brutish laughs
From the flat and the wild dog downstairs

JAWBONE AND THE AIR-RIFLE 

The rabbit killer left his home for the clough
And said goodbye to his infertile spouse
Carried air rifle and firm stock of wood
Carried night-site telescope light

A cemetery overlooked clough valley of mud
And the grave-keeper was out on his rounds
Yellow-white shirt buried in duffle coat hood
Keeping edges out with mosaic color stones

Jawbone and the air rifle
Who would think they would bring harm?
Jawbone and the air rifle
One is cursed and one is borne

The air rifle lets out a mis-placed shot
It smashed a chip off a valued tomb
Grave-keeper tending wreath-roots said
"Explain, move into the light of the moon"

"I thought you were rabbit prey, or a loose sex criminal"

Rifleman he say "Y'see I get no kicks anymore
From wife or children four
There's been no war for forty years
And getting drunk fills me with guilt
So after eight, I prowl the hills
Eleven o'clock, I'm tired to fuck
Y'see I've been laid off work"

The grave-keeper said
"You're out of luck
And here is a jawbone caked in muck
Carries the germ of a curse
Of the Broken Brothers Pentacle Church
Formed on a Scotch island
To make you a bit of a man"

Jawbone and the air rifle
Who would think they would bring harm?
Jawbone and the air rifle
One is cursed and one is warm

The rabbit killer did not eat for a week
And no way he can look at meat
No bottle has he anymore
It could be his mangled teeth
He sees jawbones on the street
Advertisements become carnivores
And roadworkers turn into jawbones
And he has visions of islands, heavily covered in slime
The villagers dance round pre-fabs
And laugh through twisted mouths
Don't eat
It's disallowed
Suck on marrowbones and energy from the mainland

Jawbone and the air rifle
Who would think they would bring harm?
Jawbone and the air rifle
One is cursed and one is gone


HIP PRIEST 

He's not appreciated.
He's not appreciated.
He's not appreciated.

Drink the long draught, Dan,
for the Hip Priest.

I said drink the long draught, Dan,
for the Hip Priest!

He's not appreciated
He's not appreciated

White collar hits motorway services
It's the Hip Priest
From the eyes he can see, they know
It's the Hip Priest

He's not appreciated.

It's purple psychology.
Not just an old lady's.

That's hip hip hip hip hit hit hit Hip Priest

That's hip hip hip hip hit hit hit Hip Priest

And he's gonna make an appearance.
He's gonna make an appearance.

Was shown in a freakshow early on.
And drunk from small brown bottles since I was so long.

Cause I'm a Hip Priest
Cause I'm a Hip Priest
People only need me when they're down and gone to seed.
Cause I'm a Hip Priest.
Cause I'm a Hip Priest.

It's appreciation half won.
And they hate their allegiance to hip preacher one.
Hip Priest

I got my last clean dirty shirt outta the wardrobe
I got my last clean dirty shirt outta the wardrobe
And all the good people know

That's hip hip hip hip hit hit hit Hip Priest

All the young groups know
All the young groups know
They can't ever take advantage because I'm a Hip Priest.
I was as clean as a packet of chocolate Treets.

That's hip hip hip hip hit hit hit Hip Priest

And if the good people knew they would say
He's not appreciated
He's not appreciated

So drink the long draught, Dan,
for the Hip Priest


FORTRESS 

Two hours!
With four left wing kids
I spent time in Nazi Fortress
Much discussion in room C-H-1-O-C-H-11

I did not understand why
I could not accept the fact
that I'd accepted the contract
Much discussion in this institution
Much discussion in boiled beef and carrots
Room C-H-1-O-C-H-2-O-11

It was clear in the window eye
The brick outlined the blue sky
And I had to go round the gay graduates in the toilets
And Good King Harry was there (fucking Jimmy Saville)

Much discussion in room C-H-1-O-C-H-2-O-11
Much discussion in room C-H-1-O-C-H-2-O-11


DEER PARK 

I took a walk down West 11
I had to wade through 500 European punks
In an off-license I rubbed up with some oiks [1]
Who threw some change on the Asian counter
And asked polite if that covered two lagers
A hospital discharge asked me where he could crash

Have you been to the English Deer Park?
It's a large type artist ranch
This is where C Wilson wrote Ritual in the Dark
Have you been to the English Deer Park?

Spare a thought for the sleeping promo dept.
They haven't had an idea in two years
Dollars and deutchmarks keep the company on its feet
Say have you ever have a chance to meet
Fat Captain Beefheart imitators with zits?
Who is the King Shag Corpse?

Have you been to the English Deer Park?
It's a large type minstrel ranch
This is where C Wilson wrote Ritual in the Dark

The young blackies get screwed up the worst
They've gone over to the Hampstead house suss
In the English system they implicitly trust
See the A&R civil servants
They get a sex thrill out of a sixteenth of Moroccan

You got Manny in the library
Working off his hangover 3:30
You get the spleen at 3:15
But it's 3:13

The mad kid walked left-side south-side towards me
He was about 7
His mother was a cleaning lady
She had a large black dog
And the mad kid said:
"Gimme the lead
Gimme the lead
Gimme the lead"
I'd just walked past the alcoholics' dry-out house
The lawn was littered with cans of Barbican
There was a feminist's Austin Maxi parked outside
With anti-nicotine anti-nuclear stickers on the side
...on the inside and they didn't even smoke...

Anyway two weeks before the mad kid had said to me
"I'll take both of you on,
I'll take both of you on"
Then he seemed the young one
He had a parka on and a black cardboard Archbishop's hat
With a green-fuzz skull and crossbones
He'd just got back from the backward kids' party
Anyway then he seemed the young one
But now he looked like the victim of a pogrom

WINTER 2 

On the first floor of the dryout house
Was a replica dartboard
And the man on the floor
Sorta went out of window, over the lawn
And round to the mad kid
"Please take this medallion,
Please wear this medallion.
It's no sign of authority.
Wear the gold and put it on"

Courtesy winter
(Winter)

So [around the] mad kid
Man on the first floor said
"I just looked round
I just looked round
I just looked round
"And my youth it was sold"

Two white doves cross the sky
There fly krakens
And sometimes, that little.....
Makes me tremble
Courtesy winter

The mad kid had 4 lights, the average is 2.5 lights
The mediocre has 2 lights, the sign of genius is three lights
There's one light left, that's the one light
That's the science law

JUST STEP S'WAYS 

When what used to excite you does not
Like you've used up all your allowance of experiences
Head filled with a mass of too-well-known people
(This is an important aspect of Big Priest.
His hypnotic induction process.
His commercial last chance)

Just step sideways from this world today
Just step sideways round this place today

Just step sideways round this world today
Just step outside this grubby place today
Don't ever hit that vulgar cave
The joker says: 'Go the opposite way'
Just step outside this futurist world today
Just step right round this...today
The Eastern Bloc rocks to Elton John.
So just step sideways from this place today
To be a celebrity you've gotta eat the past, nowadays
But who wants to be in a Hovis advert, anyway?
Just step right round this futurist world today
Just step outside this grubby place today
Just skip out miss the ice flicks of Bacardi
Just step outside this future world today

Don't let it beat ya
Don't let it whip ya
Jump on the back of nicotine
Hit those lung wurm back rays
Just step outside this future world today
Today X6
...world today
Just step sideways from this place today
Jump on the back of nicotine
Hit those lung-wurm back-rays
Just step outside this future world today

ICELAND 

A plate steel object was fired
And I did not feel for my compatriots
Hated even the core of myself
Not a matter of ill-health
It was fear of weakness deep in core of myself
The fact attainment was out of...

Mounting orations
..populations
To be humbled in Iceland
Sing of legend, sing of destruction
Witness the last of the god-men
Hear about Megas Jonsson [1]

Cast the runes against your own soul
There is not much more time to go
Work fifteen hours for the good of the soul
And be humbled in Iceland

Sit in the gold room
Fall down flat in the Cafe Iol [2]
Without a glance from the clientele
Good coffee black as well,
Hair blond as hell
Cast the runes against your own soul
Roll up for the underpants show
And be humbled in Iceland

And the spawn of the volcano
Is thick and impatient
Like the people around it.
See a green goblin redhead, redhead
Make a grab for the book of prayers.
Do anything for a bit of attention
Get humbled in Iceland

What the goddamn fuck is it?
That played the pipes of aluminum
A Memorex for the Krakens
That induces this rough text
And casts the runes against the self-soul
And humbles in Iceland

AND THIS DAY 

Everywhere

No matter what and never [?] who fills baskets or who's just there
You show me the bloody poor bores

LOOK, KNOW 

Do y'know what you look like
Before you go out?

But I say happy memories
Leave a bitter taste
I need a good brainwash agent
To cut out this present shout of:

Do y'know what you look like
Before you go out?

That's why you eat crap food
That's why nobody talks to you
That's why you messed up everything you do

Do y'know what you look like
Before you go out?
Look Know
Look

He was the first one to wear a flying jacket and go to a club
And she has the general policy of not being seen dead in a pub
Straight-leg jeans when she goes out
There's a microbe attached to their brains that itches
And gives a morning shout

Do y'know what you look like
Before you go out?

But I say happy memories leave a bitter taste
I got a prison in me
Our bodies weren't made for times like these
I always have a wash
And that's enough

Do y'know what you look like
Before you go out?

You gotta know what you look like nowadays
Before you go out
Or some existential crap will write about you
They say don't drink alcohol!
You gotta know what you look like, oh!
Before you go out
Know, look, look

But I say get it down yer neck
Ein beer
And I will you and you attack attack
Pure Satre food
Catchment club

Do y'know what you look like
Before you go out?

With all the fashions you filched off faggots
With all the fashions you filched off faggots

Do y'know what you look like
Before you go out?

Here's health!


I'M INTO C.B. 

Well I've never had a car
Never been near a lorry
Got a nasty habit of scratching my nose
My codename's Happy Harry
I'm into CB

I've had loads of jobs
For very minute lolly
Creation schemes
So I suppose I was lucky
And the money it took
To buy a CB set
Took lines off my belly
My codename's Cedar Plank
I'm Into CB
I'm Into CB

At 16 I drank cheap sherry
Got plastered in the stations and swing parks
Off my mother I stole some money
Had a treat with a bottle of Martini
So sick I couldn't walk or sit
Since then I've not touched it
I won't bore you with tales of being greedy
I'm just into CB
I'm into CB

My family's a weird lot
My stepsister's got a horrible growth
Listens to all this muzak shit
Reads Smash Hits while she's eating her tea
To me it sounds like bad CB

My father's not bad really
He got me these wires and bits
Apart from that he talks to me hardly
I'm just into CB

This is Happy Harry Plank
from the land of waving palms
calling out to Cedar Plank
477 CC 
There's no Code 13
In the home of chocolate city
I'm having trouble with the terminology
But I'm into CB

I've got this letter before me
It's buff with a confidential seal
I'd better open it
It's a fine and a formal threat
I should of listened to New Face in Hell
The date expired last week
Up here I forget what time it is
It says you're going to go when you go
Or else you're for it boy
If that's what you get for having a hobby
Next mail you get will be mail in jail
If that's what you get for having a hobby
Next year mail in jail
It that's what you get for having a hobby
Next time I'm out I'll join a riot
That's the last you'll hear for me
I'll keep clear of CB
Keep clear of CB

JOKER HYSTERICAL FACE 

They say nothing ever changes
Which is certainly true of the Poly-ocracy
The sweetest sound she had ever heard
Was the whinging and crying due to the recession.
In fact, if you get up pretty close enough

She had a Joker Hysterical Face

Her back head's full of skriking kids [1]
There's no cure so find a case for it
There's no cure so find a case for it
Let's face it, you don't make the same mistake twice X2

Joker Hysterical Face!

Ted Rogers' brains burn in hell [2]
Ted Rogers' brains burn in hell
And there's no cure so find a case for it
There's no cure so find a case for it
Let's face it, you don't make the same mistake twice X2

Joker Hysterical face!

By order of the assessor
There's no cure so find a case for it
There's no cure so find a cause against it
He made a mistake three times at least
Let's face it, you don't make the same mistake twice X2

Joker Hysterical Face!

When he came home, the hi-fi was playing
She threw his dinner down on the table
And there's no cure so find a cause for it
There's no cure so find a case for it
Let's face it, you don't make the same mistake twice
Let's face it, you don't make the same mistake twice
When he'd finished eating, the hi-fi cried

Your face! (x10)
[...]
Your face! (x10)


MARQUIS CHA-CHA 

He can never go home
He can never go home


Stranded in South America
Nothing to go home for
Just another Brit in the bar
Hernandez Fiendish comes over to me
Offers a job as broadcaster
That's how I came to be


Marquis Cha Cha
He can never go home
But is O.K. by him
The generals have many enemies
And them I single out
What does it concern me about?
Good riddance to my native country
It never did a thing for me
It's a better life here
And I am not a traitor


Marquis Cha Cha
He can never go home
Now here is his show


Hey you people over there
And those in sea and air
It has been theirs for years
It is a good life here
Football and beer much superior
Gringo gets cheap servant staff
Low tax and a dusky wife


Intelligentsia
Although your radio has been jammed
I heard talk about by chance
You educated kids know what you're on about
You've been oppressed for years
I hear Rosso-Rosso over there
And you have cha-cha clubs
You should hear the rosso-rosso stuff
I understand you


I'm from a town called
Mmmm
Marquis Cha Cha
He can never go home
He can never go home


One point is made here
The scourge of rosso-rosso
So what if I do propaganda?
After a few steins I feel better
But that broken down fan
They never fix it, them dumb Latins
There's a bayonet beside my head
There's a guard in the annex
Marquis Cha Cha
He never did go home



HARD LIFE IN COUNTRY 

It's hard to live in the country
In the present state of things
Your body gets pulled right back
You get a terrible urge to drink


At three a.m.
The stick people recede
The locals get up your nose
And leather soles stick on cobble stones


It's hard to live in the country
It has a delicate ring
Nymphette new romantics come over the hill
It gets a bit depressing


Paper local
Drunken scandal
Publish your address as well
Locals surround where you dwell
Old ladies confiscate your gate railings
For government campaigns


Its tough in home country
Councils hold the ring
D. Bowie look-alikes
Permeate car parks
Grab the churches while you can
Port-a-loos
Yellow cabins by methodist doors
New Jersey car parks permeated by
D. Bowie [sound-alikes]


It's good to live in the country
You can get down to real thinking
Walk around look at geometric tracery
Hedgehogs skirt around your leathered soles
Fall down drunk on the road
It's good to live in the country


Look at yourself as a man
The valley rings with ice-cream vans
It's good to live in the country


Leather soles stick on precinct flagstones
Small up town Americas like your outskirt town


The villagers
Are surrounding the house
The locals have come for their due
It's hard to live in the country


ROOM TO LIVE 

Some people want stars in eyes
Some people want eyes in stars
They've been like that for years
They've been like that for years
I suspect they're just if if if
I just want room to live

There's a new club in town
Plenty of space to posy around
It's a copy of the Peppermint Lounge
(I'll stick around the center always
Even if it is run down.)
Some people wanna be joining the club
Thinks to be on the clientele is big
I just want room to live


Foreigners and Experts go in
And through my place
Turn my home into a museum
Like the murder squad
They scan the room
For the well of inspiration
They don't tolerate ordinary folk
and folk look at me strange
But I'll give them this at least:
They pay for what they eat
Visitors and peripherers never give
I just want room to live


Some people think happy is way to live
Some men want to cram up to women
I've been down that street before
It just makes meat out of the soul
There's a D.H.S.S.S. Volvo estate
Right outside my door
With a Moody Blues cassette on the dashboard
There's no hate to the point I give
I just want room to live


Violence is just waiting for its due


Some people want money around
You can tell, they're the ones that never buy a round
And some men want reporters with no wig
And some people cannot hold their drink
They've got to tell you what they think
And some men want reporters with no wig
I just want room to live


DETECTIVE INSTINCT 

You can tell by his fashion
That boy's been in prison
Detective instinct
Detective instinct
Always do it
Two thugs knocked down an old tree for an old lady's whim
Detective instinct
They were reasonable at first, it seemed
Detective instinct
Detective instinct
A retired of integrity
He was a blubbering heap
He should have served himself up
Preferably in a restaurant with meat
And wit...
...goes with
Detective instinct
Sticks some paper under the door at 8 p.m.
And my razor blades will cut down your entrance
Detective instinct
Detective instinct
The man at the bar had a v-neck vest on
No, it was a v-neck waistcoat
Accurate
Detective instinct
That's detective instinct
Always got it
Sticks some paper under the door at 8 p.m.
My razor blades will cut down your entrance
Detective instinct X 3
Always got it X3
Detective instinct X 5


SOLICITOR IN STUDIO 

Young dicks make TV
Get 'em away from me
Young dicks make TV
Loads of hair-style ideals
Here's the other end of the tale
Here's the other end of the scale


Law expert makes studio
He had waited so long
Patrick Moore got a manifesto
He learned the words
Vid king and spontaneous
He learned the words
Analysis and through video


Solicitor in studio
If he got it right
Could be a celebrity
Like M. Pike [1]


Scientists and their bloody childish reading habits
Scientists and their bloody childish reading habits


But solicitor in studio
Soon ran into trouble


From the start, trouble with mike
Noises and high pitched wines
Aggressive interviewer much too fast
Then up came Beaumont Dark
Ripped his argument to shreds


Solicitor in studio
Who ran into trouble


He inadvertently proved the point
That his profession was rot


Shh Shh Shh


Solicitor in studio
Who soon ran into trouble


PAPAL VISIT 

Hosannah
First impressions...
Hosannah
Papal did visit, human trash
Waste
Prostrate, yellow-white umbrellas
Roam around
Universal love..for them...for the....
Papal visit
Human trash roam the town
Woke up by hosannah
Helicopters strip the land
First impressions will be the last
Woke up at 2
The man from iron
What happened to the man from iron
Mediator one
Human trash
Come for the visit
Eating lay bread
From what they come to call it
Sound like a yokel
For the first time
First impression will be the last
[Pope stuff continues....]
Peace resounds
Lay bread
Is in the nose and mouth
For the first time
In the assassin line
Papal visit
In the town
For the first time
Understood the assassin line
Is all around

LIE DREAM OF A CASINO SOUL 

Well, I didn't eat the weekend
But I put the weight back on again
And our kid got back from Munich
He didn't like it much
Has a psyche that hadn't been synthesized
Just like machines
It's getting like that here now
It just goes to show

I got no nerves left Monday morning
And I think I'll cut my dick off
The trouble it got me in
Went home to my slum canyon
On my way I looked up
I saw turrets of Victorian wealth
I saw John the ex-fox
Sleeping in some outside bogs
There's a silent rumble
In the buildings of the night council
It's a meeting of controllers
Who drive right through the gates
In white roll-tops

And I guess this just goes to show
The lie dream of the casino soul

I'm a bit jagged right now
In a tongue-tired, wired state
Cause Sunday morning dancing
I had an awake dream
I was in the supervision dept.
Of a bigtown store
Security floors one to four
They had cameras in the clothes dummies.
A man came up to them
He wanted sex in the dummies eyes
Then came up the cry:
"Security, mobilized!"
Meanwhile in the sticks
Proles rich, dance in cardboard pants
And I guess this goes to show
The lie dream of a casino souls scene

FANTASTIC LIFE 

Got eighteen months for espionage
Too much brandy for breakfast
And people tend to let you down
It's a swine.
Fantastic life


Dole penicillin to eastern ching plague-ridden
And one thing I have found
What you cast out will hit back
And a man will find he has to deny his
Fantastic life


Ours is not to look back
Ours is to continue the crack


Met a 54 year old dustbin man
And '48 he'd been in Jerusalem
Sold surplus oil to Arab fighters 
For M-cocktails to burn Jewish terrorists
What a turn-up!
Fantastic life


Style's too easy to buy nowadays
And there's interference with the mail
And you just can't get out the words
Some people think if they had a job they'd be well
Now!
A fantastic lie!


The Siberian mushroom Santa
Was in fact Rasputin's brother
And he didst walk round Whitechapel
To further the religion of forgiven sin murder
Fantastic lie!


No lie, friend called David
He said he had a barney on Corporation Street
He said he told the policeman what he really thought
But knowing him I don't believe that crap
A Fantastic lie


And I just thought I'd tell you
And I just thought I'd tell you
About fantastic life


And I just thought I'd tell you
Some fantastic lies


And I just thought I'd tell you
And I just thought I'd tell you


I walked right (West) round Wakefield Jail
A fantastic life
And I just thought I'd tell you
And I just thought I'd tell you
EAT Y'SELF FITTER 

I'm in the furniture trade
Got a new job today
But stick the cretin
On the number-three lathe


Went down the town
To a HM club
The sign had a cross
Through a couple well-dressed
They looked at my coat
They looked at my hair
An Easy Rider coot
Grabbed the edge of my coat
Said: 'You're too smart for here'
I said: 'I'll see the manager'


He was the manager

Analytics on me

Have been swallowed up
By a cuddly group
Who land and rub off
Hoping that
Whatever it is
Will land and drop off

Got trapped in the door
Felt a fool, I tell ya


Charmed to meet ya

We are The Fall

NEIGHBOURHOOD OF INFINITY (Live from Palace Of Swords Reversed)

The man whose head expanded knew:
a) Who stole cafe collection box
b) Stupid facade behind Jurgen
d) Who wore a red scarf to remind him of his fiancee
e) The love of Paris, infects the civil service lichen on the North

It was the time of the giant moths In the neighborhood of infinity

I used to have this thing about Link Wray
I used to play him every Saturday
God Bless Saturday!
God Bless Saturday!

WE ARE THE FALL!
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF INFINITY!

It was the time of the Giant Moths
It happens... It happens... Instincts lost... It happens... Lost
Through purple blossoms... It happens... The desire will turn rotten

WE ARE THE FALL!

GARDEN 

The first god had in his garden
From the back looked like a household pet
When it twirled round was revealed to be
A three-legged black-grey hog

See what flows from his mushy pen
Garden
Garden

That person is films on TV five years back at least
He's the young generation dancing troupe
Try'na perform Country And Western
Do a dance here

Never since birth not eaten in a day
Never since courtship stayed up some nights
He had a "Kingdom Of Evil" book under a German history book
He was contrite like that

See what flows from his slushy pen
Garden
Garden

Small, small location on huge covenance sodomised by presumption
Crooked traitor past revealed at last

When phones ring and are inconvenient to the ears, I just press table lamp light button next to my bed and they blow up. I got the idea from a book. Yours sincerely, Mr Reg Varney [1]

The same thing [?] could have been taken for a spoilt slate with largesse resource. His ferry stopped at the 'Pool port. Wild Bill Hick shaves and charts at last. The second god's sad - he's coming up - he's waiting number four with a [?]. Less stylish porch, we have the second god's influence. Wild Bill Hick shaves and charts at last.

The second god lived by mountains that flowed
By the blue shiny lit roads
Had forgot what others still tried to grasp
He knew the evil of the phone
He knew the evil of the phone
The bells stopped on Sunday when he rose
The bells stopped on Sunday when he rose

He's here
He's here at last
I saw him

He's on the second floor
Up the brown baize lift shaft

HOTEL BLOEDEL 

And it's painless
Sitting in subterranea
Ancient reference
To Mesopotamia


And it's quiet again
Hidden fragments, surface now
Repetitious history
One more time for the record


2013 Philippsburg Confederate graves
Are uncovered, throwing new light on
This 19th century conflict, sparking a repeat
These southern spectres were disease ridden, dusty, organic
And psychic


Rebellious mistakes
Occur again
Everything moving
In a circular fashion


Our words return in patterns
Our minds, encapsulating time


Gregoror, satiated walking thru' capitol
Stumbles on two thousand dead Thai monks in SS uniforms
Then fled to Hotel Bloedel, outside Nuremberg
A long way south, to a reasonable smell of death


And it's quiet again
Hidden figments, surface now
Repetitious history
One more time for the record

I FEEL VOXISH 


A pillbox crisp

Offer, offer, it was not an unreasonable offer

A pillbox crisp, that French git
The spikes he left in the bathroom
And I never heard from him again

Offer, offer, it was not an unreasonable offer
But it made me hungry
For victuals could not raise nor buy

I feel voxish, stack-heeled Hari Krish
Those disgusting [vegan new/youth punks]
Caught my life mould, give me silenced lectures

Offer, offer, it was not an unreasonable offer
But it made me hungry
For victuals could not raise nor buy

I've been sharpening a knife in the bathroom
On a brick I got from the garden
No one will fuck with me again

Offer, offer, it was not an unreasonable offer
But it made me hungry
For victuals could not raise nor buy

Feel vox crisp
And voxish


TEMPO HOUSE 

A serious man
In need of a definitive job
He had drunk too much
Mandrake anthrax
Pro-rae, pro-rae
Oloron


Tormented tots
With Burton weeping
His idiot contacts
Pro-rae, pro-rae


Put your claim into Tempo House
Go round there to Tempo House
Go round and have a grouse
Put your claim into Tempo House


Roll the chubby round jowls
Roll the chubby round jowls
And Burton's weeping
His chairs are weeping
God damn the pedantic Welsh
Pro-rae, pro-rae


Put your claim into Tempo House
Go round there to Tempo House
Go there and have a grouse
Put your claim into Tempo House


I'd sing "Solitaire" for the B.E.F.
But who wants to be with them, anyway?
Snow on Easter Sunday
Jesus Christ in reverse
I tell ya, the Dutch are weeping
In four languages at least
Oloron
Pro-rae


And Burton is weeping


Put your claim into Tempo House
Put your claim into Tempo House
Go round and have a grouse
Put your claim into Tempo House


Illness, pollution, should be encouraged and let loose
Then maybe some would have a genuine grouse
Spring right out of the fetters
Right away from 63 Market Place
Tempo House address
Pro-rae, pro-rae
Oloron


Winston Churchill had a speech imp-p-p-pediment [1]
And look what he did
He razed half of London
And the Dutch are weeping
Lusted after French paintings
Pro-rae, pro-rae


Put your claim into Tempo House
Go round there and have a grouse
Go round, have a grouse
Put your claim into Tempo House

HEXEN DEFINITIVE - STRIFE KNOT 

Tied up to posts 
Blindfold so can't feel maintainance
Kickback art thou that thick?
Death of the dimwits

Businessman hits train
Businessman hits train
His veiled sex seeps through his management sloth
The journey takes one hour

And its a hexen hour
Hexen school
Hexen cursed
Hexen bowl boils
Hexen rule
Explain the mood harm


The DDR scene
Alpine pullovers
Alpine give over 
You can clutch at my toes
You will drive me insane 
You know nothing about it
It's not your domain
Don't confuse yourself with someone who has something to say
Cause its a hexen rain
Hexen fodder 
Hexen cursed
Hexen bowl boils
Hexen rule explain the mood harm


While greenpeace looked like saffron on the realm
Brown, shrivelled
A Kellog's peace
The opposition was down
Red church on a hill
Red church on a hill 
Styrofoam insides
Aluminium tiers
Louis Armstrong tapes waft down the aisles
And its a hexen hour 
Hexen file
Hexen rule
Hexen bowl boils
Hexen rule in the hour of the fall


It takes grace to play the second fiddle well
His cap emblazoned a crusty knife
Scab-ridden physog was these you ate
Goes with you down, and pats your head

That's strife knot
Strife ker-not
Strife is life and don't forget it
Strife is life, you don't wanna hear it
Could be thirteen or thirty one of this mob
Could be thirteen or thirty one of this mob
Strife knot
Strife ker-not


Life is strife but you don't wanna hear it
Strife is life and that's it
And that's it, and that's it
And that's it


THE MAN WHOSE HEAD EXPANDED 

The man who's head expanded.

The man whose head expanded was corrupted by Mr. Sociological
memory. Was corrupted by Mr. Sociological Memory Man.
Could not get a carrier bag for love nor money.

The man whose head expanded.
Sounds like hick wap huh? Sounds like hick wap huh?
Over. Over. Over. Over.

The man who's head expanded.

The soap opera writer, would follow him around
and use his jewels for T.V. prime time.
The man who's head expanded.

Turn that bloody blimey space invader off!

The man who's head expanded explained:
The scriptwriter would follow him around,
of this he was convinced. It was no coincidence.
The lager seemed poisoned.
It was no matter of small consequence. No little pub incidence.
A red faced post- 'Jolly Grapes' would steal his jewels, and put
them in the mouths of Vic. actor fools.
Of this he was convinced.

Sounds like hick wap huh? Sounds like a load of mick wap ha?
Over. Over. Over. Over.

The man whose head expanded. The man whose head expanded.

Does not want to appear illiterate.
Crack! Crack!
Does not want to appear illiterate.
Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack!

The man who's head expanded. Come on with the heraldry.
Add misinterpretation, prerogative.
John Kennedy's pulmanesque explained. [pub-asp slyness]

The man who's head diminished. The man who's head
diminished. Sounds like my head, trying to unravel this lot,
I can tell you Sparky!

LUDD GANG 

(Ludd gang, Ludd gang..)
Ports, Jap, fella, missed, film, swiz, quartz, lorry, back, tread, damn, ludd gang

The housing association
The MacDonald's seat
Have prefixed him "frustration"
I'll stick with the gang of one

I'll make a stand with the Ludd Gang

Carve a hole in the rain for yer
Carve a hole in the rain for yer

Courage my sweet
Courage my sweet
Courage my sweet
It's the quiet like death
It's the choir-ette of death

Carve a hole in the rain for yer
Carve a hole in the rain for yer

I hate the guts of Shakin' Stevens
For what he has done
The massacre of "Blue Christmas"
On him I'd like to land one on

But I'll stick with the gang of one
Carve a hole in the rain for yer

Courage my sweet
Courage my sweet
It's a quiet like death
It's the choir-ette of death

The housing association foiled the reign of the rain
For this, MacDonald is truly grateful

Cab driver asks why I'm not
At home with my feet put up (campaigns run amok, brick a window, run amok)

Whats, Jap, lorry, back, feather, next, bishops, ludd gang

WINGS 

Day by day.
The moon gains on me.
Day by day.
The moon gains on me.


Purchased pair of flabby wings.
I took to doing some HOVERING.
Here is a list of incorrect things.


HOVERED mid-air outside a study.
An academic kneaded his chin,
sent in the dust of some cheap magazines.
His academic rust, could not burn them up.


Recruited some gremlins.
To get me clear of the airline routes.
I paid them off with stuffing from my wings.
They had some fun with those cheapo airline snobs.


The stuffing loss made me hit a timelock.
I ended up in the eighteen sixties.
I've been there for one hundred and twenty five years.
A small alteration of the past. Can turn time into space.


Ended up under Ardwick Bridge.
With some veterans from the U.S. Civil War.
They were under Irish patronage.
We shot dead a stupid sergeant,
but I got hit in the crossfire.
The lucky hit made me hit a time lock.


But, when I got back.
The place I made the purchase, no longer exists
I'd erased it under the bridge.


Day by day.
The moon came towards me
By such things.
The moon came towards me.


So now I sleep in ditches.
And hide away from nosey kids.
The wings rot and feather under me.
The wings rot and curl right under me.
A small alteration of the past.
Can turn time into space.
Small touches can alter more than a mere decade.


Wings x 17

LAY OF THE LAND 

Lay
Lay
Lay
Armageddon
This beautiful tree
Boo hoo
Give up living
Ample 
Eye
They give in


On The Buses, up the stair
By the television
Pretend to learn


Where's the lay of the land
My son


Where's the lay of the land
My son
What's the lie of the land
My son


The last Briton on the street
He's in a radio fuzz
He's dead and beat
No longer reflects our daft fate
We'll leave this city
Hit a quick coach, take the town in Surrey
There's no-one here but crooks and death
Kerb-crawlers,of the worst order


Where's the lay of the land
My son
What's the lie of the land
My son


Eldritch house
With green moss
Sound of ordinary on the waves
Tiles drip from its roof
Home secretary has a weird look


Where's the lay of the land
My son
What's the lie of the land
My son


The good Book of John
Surrounds the son
Sound of ordinary on the waves
Italic scribble on horizon
When the height of culture is a bad stew
Space bores, government disorder
Indian clerk, low-calorie drink
Where's the lay of the land
Where children circle in cycles
Giving jokes ad lib
By bearded writers
Who defected to
Higher realms
Advertising realms


Where's the lay of the land
My son
What's the lie of the land
My son

(People laughing..people fighting..people watching)

Between the ticker and the mind lies an air-block of wind



2 X 4 

He was agin the rich
He was agin the poor
He was against all trepidation


He was agin the rich
On the loose again
He was agin the rich


There's a new fiend on the loose
On the back of the exhaust clip
Clipped on rich and poor alike
Come to roost again once more


Ol' Nick doesn't go from digs to digs no more
Hit him on the head with a 2 by 4
Nowadays he has a Georgian glazed porch


Used table leg to club son in law


New fiend in your home again
He said show me my quarters and glasses


There's a new fiend on the loose
Jolting in his tradition
It's a fear of the obtuse
He's got patents on the moaning



COPPED IT 

Said I ain't no millionaire
But I spent more money than one ever seen
I'm gonna change that scene one day
It's what you're supposed to say
Hey hey hey hey


Can't get far in land of immovable frogs
Can't get far in home of horrible hoax
And you don't last long on a diet of tea and toast


Hey hey hey
And I'm singing the song cause I copped it baby
I steal what I have


Fascist confessions bring detractors
Keeping shtum
Brings dough and attractions
Costello, ideas trenchant borrows
New song benefactor
Is the past tomorrow


Sing, sing a song
I'm singing the song cause I copped it baby


Don't last long
There's guns behind you
Aura of desparate boot licker
And you can't hang on with a cuff of him and girl


I'm singing a song cause I copped it baby


Taking out a policy for love and destruction
Can't operate with this vexation
Say it again, real real gone
I know I've copped but I'm not the only one.


It ain't what you do it's the way that you do it



ELVES 

When will the good Scotch return?
In all its scarred, splendor,
When will the price of Scotch come down?


Here's him in nearly '85
Hanging around with pop scum
It's not the business I despise
On this train, extended ride
It's the Scotch end of the market now


And steel glasses
And bad music corpses
Cannot hide the new rock scum
Spitting on what's good and gone
Spitting on what's good and gone
When will the price of Scotch come down?


Arrangement before job done
Alignment before job done
Assignment before song sung
Alignment before job done


All of this fantastic league's against me
The Fantastic is in league against me


Tin-can rattle on the path
The [bestial greed] is on the attack
The cat black runs round the tree
The siamese reached the shore
The siamese reached the shore


No never, no never no more
will I trust the elves of Dunsimore (repeated)


OH! BROTHER 

[Mecass, the mass, decline, domain, relan, drazan, my heart's blocked, rout]
Oh! little brother
We are in a mess
Don't look at me that way
Don't put me to the test
When I first saw you
People said:
"He scrutinised a little monster"
And disappeared through red door
Now everyone is disinformation
Disinformation
Disinformation
He says:
"Won't you give me one more chance?"
"I'm not a communist"

Disinformation x 3


[Mecass, the mass, decline, domain, relan, drazan, my heart's blocked, rout]

Oh! little brother
We are in a mess
Don't look at me that way
Your d-jacket's a mess [1]
There's always
Someone beside you
And there's always
Someone in your arms
Oh! little brother
If only I had known
Then I might not
Be alone X4


DRAYGO'S GUILT 

I am the one who gave you a chance in life
How could you try and end my life


Chorus:
Draygo's guilt
Still apparent
Draygo's guilt
Still


How long is long in a hellish place?
And dreams today are draining us dry
And I proclaim some loyalty frightened me
Master bold morals get reptiles and ankles


Chorus


A spiritual king has to rise or perish
And throw away the charity handouts
Blow his nose on last pound note
Scan window menus and walk away but


Chorus

Sit still
Hate from the hills


And all the bands still dream of photo-Draygo
The county of Lancs dreams of photo-Draygo
Guitars in hands that turn and stab you
And sexy with bass dreams of photo-Draygo
but


Chorus


Hate from the hills


How many times do I have to say this
I should not have to say this
But each time the blood was clear like liquid gold



GOD BOX 

MES: It's good that one innit. What is it?
BES: It's something I'm working on
MES: Right


Couldn't handle, had to be
I turned on US TV
Early empires sleeping, Pacific time frame
Redhead skinny with back leg-brace
He danced behind a singer
Who sung just like god box


Chorus:
God box
Gimme god box
I say god box
God box, early
Tube stop, lazy
Cut off, early
God box
Gimme God box
I said
God box
Narco tube stops
Gimme god box


I was taken under the sea
The water coming in over me
I'm gulping water under the lake
Oh my god give me sleep, inundate


Chorus


Thousand evils indefinitely
Womb shapes by a cold sea
At 9, UK time
We dropped off before god box documentary


CLEAR OFF 

When the off license asks
I've been 2 months
Checks the crack
On their forehead
Should comb a hair
Over that


And these Czech shoes
Are a bloody reminder
And this town
Is not much different
The clothes, the stooped appearance


Over the hill
goes killer civil servant


I still remember
The white leafy border
The scheiss in winter


Over the hill
goes killer civil servant


There's a song she had before
Borough town
That had the snappy rejoinder


Who's there?
What's wrong?
Clear off!


C.R.E.E.P. 

He reads books; of the list book club
And after two months--his stance a familiar hunch
It's that same slouch - you had the last time he came around


His oppression abounds, his type is doing the rounds
He is a scum-egg; a horrid trendy wretch


C.R.E.E.P. CR E.E.P.


BLACK saucers at the back of your neck
Interruptions, from the side when you talk
in the presence, of this ugly gawk,
is offending, make sure you're not absorbed
(With hideous luck - he'll absorb all your talk)


CR E.E.P. C.R.E.E.P. (3 times)


FROM the bright sun, he came one fine morn
"Populist" - as well in his class at least
But then came REAL AGE, and for that we all must pay
(and for that we all do pay)


c.r.e.EP. C.R.E.E.P.
C.R. EEP C.R.E.E.P


CR E.E.P. - cr E.E.P. CR E.E.P. - CR E.EP (2 times)


And he wants world peace! (and for that we all must pay)


He likes ABC! (C.R.EE.P.)
C.R.EE.P. CR.E.E.P. (2 times)
CREEP!



PAT-TRIP DISPENSER 

He moves slow at the petrol stop
It's Pat the trip dispenser
He came with solvent in his hair
The trip dispenser


Spine-fuhrer of Hoboken
It's Pat the trip dispenser
Friend of Syndicate of Sound
Pigeon toed band


McGinty thought he could fool the Fall
With his imitation speeds
But he had not accounted for the psychic nose
He did not know there are no big shots on the rock
And even if there were, McGinty would not be among them


His head was full of icy calm
A clarity of nothing
It's Pat the trip dispenser


He paid at the generic supermarket
With paper
With paper
It's Pat the trip dispenser




SLANG KING 

You feel depressed 'cause you've missed the day
Then you have to go to the hall


Whip wire
Whip wire
Hawk man
Slip down easy
Don't make me a go-between
This is Mr. and Mrs. Smith
To whom you are speaking
Slang King
Words from a cheap man
Part-paid type who got his style 
From a press treatise
2 pound 50
Bottle of Brut and nausea
Magazine
It's no longer a journey down the road for him
It is now escape route
Bright, turn off sign
Swing, 14, turns off, between
Swingo greets lime green receptionist
All here is ace, All here is ace, All here is ace
Escape route
Caca-phony
Slang King
Swoop swoop
Foll media krieg, for his honour's binge
During his Scandinavian stint
He said hi to Horst, the viking
Hi Lo-l-lord Swingo
At his triumphant procession
Down the road of quease
Dropping off, he stopped
At a British shop
Swoop scoop
Slang King 
At a British shop
Take it down easy
During a lull in his attack
3 little girls with only 50 pence
Had to take, had to put
The Curly Wurly back
Swoop swoop, scoop scoop
Slip down easy
Slip away at court or him and his bloody mother
We'll go together
Sugar down
Slip down easy
Hyper!
Slang King
Watch, the word had right
Biz by word processor
We'll go together, slip down down away
Hyper, with the young designers
The young designers are always there
Always wanted to be there
Slip down, caca-phony
Whip wire, whip wire
Slip down easy, sugar
Slip down easy, sugar
Slip down away, sugar
Hawkman, whip wire, whip wire
Slang King



BUG DAY 

[Misereen] all its skin

Bug day
Bug day

Midges - midges hovered over the heather
3 moths shivered
Green moths shivered
Cockroaches moldered in the ground
Tonguehorns belched fire

So, fleed at sea
Terrors hit water
Minoa said 'eek' 
Minoa said 'eek'

Sea reaffirms some things
We learned some things
People behave very wrong
Create company
Green is starboard, back
Left is port, there
Old continental women 
Coffee cups poised on front

Facing up to the sea is a very hard thing
Facing up to sea is a v. hard thing
Anything is better than bug day

Bug day
Bug day
Bug day
But day

[mumbles]

Bug day

Anything is better than bug day

Bug day
Bug day


STEPHEN SONG 

It was a thing with a head like a spud ball
It was a song, the song we were looking for


I always have to state to myself
It has nothing to do with me
He has nothing
He is not me
(His vendetta parchment)


Floating grey abundance
Against my palace of conscience
(Our hero deeply loved
Moonlit walked past privet and wide-leaved foliage)


I'll tell you of the rats in this world
Fawning in place with The Face
Men coming between each other
For the sake of a two-minute urge
(It is headless)
Worth $5 in London
And cursed anon.
Our hero, still deeply loved
Moonlit walks past privet and wide leaved
It was no more a net of mesh
It was class
He did not blink a lid
He braced his self-imposed gorgeous adult net
And breeze
And it was class
And no no-man's land
Ever had this?

Their follies are strong liberation


CRAIGNESS 

Neighbour downstairs with one eye
Co-habs with a mass of blonde curls
Ooo-ar
T'pau
(Mind moving fast is mad
Mind moving slow is sane)
It's [granpathy] fits set on eyes
[Mazim] peculiar tan
He sports the maroon flares


Mind moving slow is sane
Mind moving fast is mad
Mind left stopped he's got


Writer in bed insane
Clutches pen in hand
The scrawl he wrote


Neighbour downstairs with one eye
Co-habs with a mass of blonde curls
Her shadow face


Mind moving slow is sane
Mind moving fast is mad
Mind left stopped he's got


Neighbour downstairs with one eye
Co-habs with a mass of blonde curls
Their babe cries



DISNEY'S DREAM DEBASED 

The day the dream went right back to base
There was blood on the ground
Blood on the sand
Blood all around
Tracks of the ride of the bright murder hawk
The day the dream debased and went home
And the people did mill to those adrenaline rails
And everything stopped


The nurses climbed up
Our face paled
And there was no doubt at all
No two ways about it
Was the day Disney's dream debased


Saw a mouse, who flapped at my wife
And she told him what
And she told him what had gone down
Who then did not know the extent of the show
The people had [died/gave?] in the mouth of their ride


Disney


And Dopey and Mickey, Brer and Pluto
Secretly prayed
And there was no doubt at all
No two ways about it
Was the day Disney's dream debased


Disney


Dark glasses on Western Union
Man the gates
The dream, an innocent meets her fate
Far away from Appalachia and the city hate
The day X3


When there was no doubt at all
No maybe about it
It was the day the dream debased


Disney


I remembered it from
The back of my mind
The tune that I wrote
In fallen dreams
Anthem to
Creator of all that had stopped


So there was no doubt at all
No two ways about it
It was the day the dream debased



NO BULBS 

I'm hunting and I'm tryna find
A belt in the early morn
When your home is a trash mount
Look all over but you're right out


In need of black strap
No belts in this flat


No belts in this flat
The former tenant was anti-corporal-punish
Meant well, but it came to nothing
A light has just gone out
A bulb has just gone out


No belts in this flat
No bulbs in this flat
In need of white lamp

At the end of my tether, I destroyed years of hippy craft
Cut up [?]
Of a string and wooden chandelier or something

No belts in this flat
Give me a black strap
Give me a black strap
No belts in this flat

A bulb has just gone out, a neon light I have found
Here is Reginald with the set square neck,
Laying out cool dwellings,
For the next Britain in the evening
The apartments he has made
He is genius in allocation of space

In need of white lamp
In need of white lamp
In need of white lamp
No lights in this flat

Not like this place, you need light here,
even in the morning,
Compared to this, St. Petersburg was nothing

In need of white lamp
In need of white lamp
In need of white lamp
I'm hunting and I'm tryna find
A belt in the early morn
When your home is a trash mount
Look all over but you're right out

They say damp records the past
if that's soI've got the biggest library yet
the biggest library yet.
BOMBAST 

All those whose mind entitles themselves,
and whose main entitle is themselves,
shall feel the wrath of my bombast!

Clanging in my heart.
Bastard! Idiot!

Feel the wrath of my bombast!

Bastard idiot!
Feel the wrath.
Those who dare mix real life with politics
And go on regardless of the..of the discoveries
Will feel the wrath of bombast
clanging in my heart

All those whose mind entitles themselves
and whose main entitle is themselves
shall feel the wrath of my bombast!


BARMY 

Out of England, I dream of its creamery
When I'm there I dwell on Saxony.
In Turkey when I've been due to World War I
Istanbul is the place 'cos of my birthday.

I am barmy
Bleedin' barmy

I got everything
I got everything I want except for hungry
I got everything I want except for money.

I've got the best round set aside for parties
They'll have one when I've gone 
In fact, they said so, good one.

I am barmy
Bleedin' barmy

Friends disintegrate within circles of cash 
Residue after years of fab genius 
Is a pension for the jews 
and a medal from the company which I wiped my butt on
and hung on a laburnum tree.

I am barmy
Bleedin'  barmy
I am barmy 
Bleedin' barmy

Just call me the first x 10

I lay waiting hopefully on sloped grass green
I am barmy, bleedin' barmy

A dramatic verse x 3

Ring a buzzer

SPOILT VICTORIAN CHILD 

Past trees the fairies are flyin
Past trees with rose bushes in
The child was spoilt Victorian
The child was spoilt Victorian

Spoilt Victorian Child

Sugar and cakes appear mean
Sitting at the table
Tigers pop-up from books

Spoilt Victorian Child

Let`s take it ten years on
You`re looking back from then
Under rough grey blankets
Thread loose stained grey blanket

Spoilt Victorian Child

C.L.O. - Pedia
E.N.C.Y.C.L.O. - Pedia

Musical chairs rouge cheeks he remembers
Thru` the aqueduct of five years
Spoilt Victorian Child shall avoid reflection
The child was spoilt Victorian

Spoilt Victorian Child

Mirrors can`t hid the toxic of disfigured Poxes

Spoilt Victorian Child

Past trees the fairies are flyin
Past trees with rose bushes in
The butterfly shrugs to fly in
Sugar and iced cakes appear mean

The child was spoilt Victorian
The child was spoilt Victorian

Spoilt Victorian Child
C.L.O. - Pedia

And you know that servants keep their order knowledge
And as you walk in on the footsteps steed babe
In the encrusted green unwild
You know you are a spoilt Victorian child

VIXEN 

It had taken her a long time
Suddenly back on its own
To sit, friendless & alone
She is friendless and alone
I'm a vixen on its own

The triple gang & the throng
Did not feel helpless or alone

The vixen got no friends
She needs a poison pen
Even in Switzerland
The people cry "vixen"

Silver cross, all alone
The bird had flown
With their omen they'll fly
Had flown, silver cross
All alone
(So millions were broken hearted)
All alone, with no home
It's all alone

And some night, wind moves the leaves
They pick themselves up & run
Perhaps all that night possessed no way of telling time

It had taken her a long time
Suddenly back on its own
To sit, friendless & alone
She is friendless and alone
A man's trust, [appalling/a pole in] debt 
To sit friendless and alone
With no home, with no home
Vixen's got no home
She is friendless and alone
A long time on its own
It shone around her
Triple gang


COULDN'T GET AHEAD 

Couldn't get ahead
I just couldn't get ahead

Come out of pub, the shop is closed
Come out of pub, Harry wants to know
When the next bus is
I said five or ten minutes
I had my change in my hands
The bus flashes past.
My hands are caught

Couldn't get ahead. I just couldn't get ahead.

In a week, earned money for month
Got all my jobs done
My eyelids were sick of it
Gist was I could sleep for a day?
But bad bills have no respect for a decent man's rest
Flopping on the doorstep
Outlined in color red

Couldn't get ahead. Just couldn't get ahead.

On an Asiatic plane with wings not of the grain
Toilet queue was endless
Couldn't get a beer
The hostesses were muslims
When I get in toilet,
Light flashes: "Return to seat."
I feared withdrawal
And I feared beer was making sludge of my head.

Couldn't get ahead. Just couldn't get ahead.

Now my problems are solved
It's a remedy of old
I pretend I'm blind you see
Put on some Armani clothes
And act like ET
Where I'm at is a cabbage patch,
no longer strewn with weeds
Have a Ghandi at me
Colour mags wish me well
No more, no get ahead.

Couldn't get ahead. Just couldn't get ahead.


GUT OF THE QUANTIFIER 

I'm telling you now and I'm telling you this
Life can be an onward, downward
Chip-chit-chip-chit-chip

I'm not saying they're really thick
But all the groups who've hit it big
Make the Kane Gang look like
an Einstein chip
chip
NYC
chip
A place to live
chip
This is the Thule group.
This is the cool group.
I'm telling you now and I'm telling you this.

Shawn and Petula Macabre
Here are your wedding pictures
They are black
Stick it in the gut
Stick in the mud.
Boffins bray
Boffins brag
Stick it in the gut
Stick in the mud.

They take from the medium poor to
give to the needy poor
Via the government poor
Give it to the poor poor
They're knocking on my door
Entrance
Entranced

Stick it in the mud
Stick it in the gut

Cheap fog
Cheap fog
Rotting scout-belt
Stick it in the gut

Who are the riff-makers.
Who are they really?
How old are the stars really?
Half-wit philanthropist, cosy charity gig
If God could see this
He'd stick it
They stick it in the gut
Cheap fog
Rotting scout-belt

Stick it in the gut
Stay in the mud
They take it from the medium poor
To give it to the medium poor
Via the government poor
And give it to the poor poor
Stick it in the gut
Red composite
Wealthy philanthropist
You son of a bitch

Entranced
Entrance
Entranced

Stick in the mud
Stick it in the gut

I'm telling you now
and I'm telling you this,
Life can be a downward chip.


MY NEW HOUSE 

My new house
You should see my house
My new house
You should see my new house

No rabbit hutch about it
I bought it off the baptists
I get the bills
And I get miffed
At the damn polyester fills 
The interior is a prison unconscious

My new house
Keep away from my new house

Wash the drawers of pills
It's got window sills
With lead centred in the middle of them

My new house
Is no beatnik hang-out

That Halifax copter
Sure dropped me a cropper

Sometimes I think I'll ring Swine-Tax [1]
And go back to my flat

But my new house
I do love the mad things about it

According to the postman
It's like the bleeding Bank of England

Creosote tar fence surrounds it
Those razor blades eject when I press eject

My new house
Could easily crack a mortal, it

The spare room is fine
Though a little haunted
By Mr. Reagan who had hung himself at number 13
Mr. Reagan hung himself at number 13

It'll be great when it's decorated
My new house

Note: [1] In Swinton, Manchester, the local mini-cab firm was called Swin-Tax


PAINTWORK 

We go two, twice all the way round those things
Two high ones, two low ones, yeah
Right man

Man stopped us at corner
He had a bloody nose
And then he opened his denim jacket
It was under his vest made out of tracing paper
Chest scars portrayed Aztec life in his horrible...

...formation really late. Main sequence stars were no good for making carbon in this way. Red giant stars...

...[surplayed].
Disfigured in a lady, tedious
Was over accountant's and on business
Then I woke up and I decided to recommence my diary
Then I read Paula Yates on vision mopeds
Then I found out we were not going to Italy [1]
Later Mam said 'Those continentals are little monkeys'
And yesterday we has liver and sausage over

And sometimes they say 'Hey Mark you're spoiling all the paintwork'
And sometimes they say 'Your thumbprints are on the paintwork'

Distractors, post-doctors behind come in
Dressed in suits, grow talons
Everyone clenched plaits horror

And sometimes they say...

And sometimes I feel like saying
This is bloody Newark
Or some drive-in slap place
In Breda and in Cologne
With the shirt [on/off]
Sun in vicinity
As if I hadn't done 10 month's service
In the USA
On media guts
[It circles is] where I start

And sometimes they say...

And I think
If I'd wanted to live in Holland
And if I'd wanted to be lived in
I'd have packed up and pissed off
When I was 16
A [Swiss good ass/as/at] this lousy business
Was the last thing I was ever imagining

Hey Mark, why can't I live in England?

[The end of shoes, all warehouse shoe/you've got
Cheap new one, the target is too yahoo
And take over all the desparate
I'll take over discussion and
....humanely regular colours over...
...engineered oxidate zeppelin 
Old world style, old man only juke box caught
All power jets on....spectacular facets]

And sometimes they say....
Hey, you're fucking up the paintwork

What is this thing they're so hard-assed about?

I thought I lived in England

Note: [1] Apparently a reference to a proposed Fall tour that was cancelled following the 1985 Heysel football tragedy.


I AM DAMO SUZUKI 

Generous of lyric, Jehovah's Witness
Stands in Cologne Marktplatz
Drums come in
When the drums come in fast
Drums to shock, into brass evil

What have you got in that paper bag?
Is it a dose of Vitamin C?
Ain't got no time for Western medicine
I am Damo Suzuki

The fuck-up like red acid rain
Give it to me Daki every day
Who is Mr. Karlheinz Stockhausen?
Introduce me
I'm Damo Suzuki

Soundtracks, Soundtracks
Melched together, the lights
The lights above you

Listener was in cahoots with Fritz Lieber
And read him every day
Recipe for fear gas, amount of salt ash
I put by [cup of] meine fire, okay
I have no time for Western medicine
I am Damo Suzuki

May we go back to days pre-Virgin
Cannot get on clear vinyl
The handle that was brass, is now brass evil
The rock that was an egg, is in wrong cradle
The hand that cradles the rock, makes egg gooey
I am Damo Suzuki

Is this west latent pattern?
Run it, says Damo's spirit
Is this lesser European?
Speak it, says Damo's spirit
I am Damo Suzuki

PETTY (THIEF) LOUT

Hide hide, all good people hang out for a result
Hide dive hide, reasonable people in silence do exult
Realm of dusk


The Northerns
Look at the North ones
Their brains are unhinged by the sun


Rare stone
Our faces are rare stone
It comes to take them
Move out the armies

SHOULDER PADS 1# 

All these fads
It's shoulder pads


On New Year's Dawn
To my surprise
All the Macca lads stayed at home
Picking antiques 
Encloses
Cosy fleck with green bits
Main undercurrent, white spermatoze


My powers
Against them, half-useless
My senses
Alive have party


Was embarrassed but stuck with them
Walked, at shoulder, down the street, ridicule
They couldn't tell Lou Reed from Doug Yule
Suppressed hate romance


It was like being back at school


My powers before them resound
My powers heard language, two-time doom


Win populace, internal defeat
Their mob had a coup d'etat
Realize what they'd always wanted
Knew I was right all along
It wasn't then a Beatles song
Superhero in harlequin kecks
Dim-wit lecture, half read
Cursing black singers ten years dead


Was a clown in victim hat
Was shouldered and spurned


Then my powers did return....


MR PHARMACIST 

Mr Pharmacist
Can you help me out today
In your usual lovely way
Oh Mr Pharmacist I insist
That you give me some of that vitamin C
Mr Pharmacist

Dear Pharmacist won't you please
Give me some energy
Mr Pharmacist

Hey Mr Pharmacist
I'll recommend you to my friends
They'll be happy in the end
Mr Pharmacist can you help
Send me on a 'delic kick
Mr Pharmacist

Dear Pharmacist use your mind
You better stock me up for the wintertime
Mr Pharmacist

Hey Mr Pharmacist
Words cannot express
Feeling I suggest
Oh Mr Pharmacist I can plead
Gimme some of that powder I need
Mr Pharmacist

Dear Pharmacist I'll be back
With a handful of empty sack
Mr Pharmacist


GROSS CHAPEL - GB GRENADIERS 

Porterage down
The dark gross chapel
He stepped streets around now
Sales person mobile


Porterage down
Dark gross chapel
He stepped streets around now
Was introduced by a woman loose-limbed, slim


One woke up to a whitewashed ugly wall - whoosh!
Made worse by dirty postcards
Trapped in their town


They're embracing criminals in panicky hall
 No temper for Fall group


I'll put you down
Porterage down
To the dark gross chapel
He stepped streets around now
Sales-person, mobile


I'll put you down
To the gross chapel


You were right said Peter
Dying for a smoke
But you shouldn't have said to the police
Jobs I do are little things
Like the chemist coming on insulted
They were as fed up as I was
Waiting outside after putting blame on you


Porterage down
Ask him! I am ailing
Porterage down

Then let us fill a bumper,
And drink a health to those
Who carry caps and pouches,
And wear the louped clothes.
May they and their commanders
Live happy all their years

Whene'er we are commanded
To storm the palisades
Our leaders march with fusees,
And we with hand grenades.
We throw them from the glacis,
About the enemies' ears.
Sing tow, row, row, row, row, row,
For the British Grenadiers.

I'll put you down


LIVING TOO LATE 

Crow's feet are ingrained on my face
And I'm living too late
Try to wash the black off my face, but it's ingrained
And I'm living too late


Sleepless, in-control spleen
Agreed ace family
Must have stump tripod in the genes
I'm immune to things
In my dreams


I saw through the trees
O'er the poison river locks
Talk treacherous would beat
But still my heart it is rock


Finally going through old parasite gate
But there's a 24-hour clock watch
And I'm living too late
Think


Sometimes life is like a new bar
Plastic seats, beer below par
Food with no taste, music grates
I'm living too late


Once talking was my favourite while
But now I know a conversation's end
Before it's done
Maybe I'm living too long


The daylight


I see trouble on the streets
Fearing catastrophe to meet
Walk down the devil's boulevard
But still my heart is hard


They say them cellars [were't even/were evil] black
But I know they're wrong
Think it's one 
Been
Living Too Long


US 80'S-90'S 

Had a run-in with Boston Immigration
And to my name had an aversion
Nervous droplets
Due to sleeping tablets

No beer
No cigarettes
Slam, spikes, gin, cigarettes
Beer in ban

The cops are tops

Welcome to the 80s 90s
Welcome to US 80s 90s

I'm the big-shot original rapper
But it's time for me to get off this crapper

Welcome to the US 80s 90s

No beer
No cigarettes
Spikes, gin, cigarettes
Whisky

Like cones of silence

Welcome to the US 80s and 90s
Like 50s, 1890s

Kentucky dead keep pouring down
By death stadium
No more amused dressing room
My ambition, but one chance in three million Jack
Like cones of silence

Cast aside over-inflation theory of the panic insists
Welcome to the US 80s 90s
Look at page 19, small column, lower right-hand side
Welcome to the 1980s

Give us a ring, give us a ring kid

Sounding sour and frustrated
With the pressure of his own life.

What are those trees 
Painted white jobs
Silvered something

50 plus 
Out to heal provincial pus
Let the real reverend walk
He says and does

He plans but they won't let him in

BOURNEMOUTH RUNNER 

Consumed with premonition
Of trouble on horizon
By my remarks I was certain
I was destined persecution

But then I took a chase after the Bournemouth Runner!
Bournemouth Runner!
C-c-could dare
Bournemouth Runner!
First night

Bournemouth Runner!
He was a Bournemouth Runner!

Bournemouth Runner!
Didn't get far
Bournemouth Runner!
First night
Bournemouth Runner!
But the second night
He got away with our guiding light

Was chilled to the bone
At 8am 
On a Bournemouth morn
There was a drum deck
Outside [Route/room] 51
Two nights before
Bristol ball
A runner took backdrop, exit hall

Bournemouth Runner!
Raced a couple of hundred yards
Bournemouth Runner!
Barman clipped his ears
Bournemouth Runner!
Spitted and shifted
Bournemouth Runner!
Backdrop dissipated
Bournemouth Runner!
He was the Bournemouth Runner!

How could we now it was the Bournemouth Runner?

Bournemouth Runner!
Raced a couple of hundred yards
Bournemouth Runner!
Barman clipped his ears
Bournemouth Runner!
Spitted and shifted
Bournemouth Runner!
Backdrop dissipated
Bournemouth Runner!
He was the Bournemouth Runner!

Took away our guiding light

Our backdrop was friendly, heavy
Often it would rumble into hotel
And partake with us
In diluted drink and dogmeat 
Of RAC recommended hostelry

Bournemouth Runner!
Shifted and twisted
Bournemouth Runner!
On beach sand sifted
Bournemouth Runner!
In the best home
Bournemouth Runner!
Locks picked
Bournemouth Runner!

Should've known better
Than to underrate
Bournemouth sucker
Took away our guiding light

Bournemouth Runner!
Calendar
Bournemouth Runner!
I'v forgotten the date
Bournemouth Runner!
No plot
Bournemouth Runner!
You're welcome
Bournemouth Runner!
It was coated in poison
Bournemouth Runner!

Have to buy a new one.......

Say! Mmmmmm-uuuaahhh
Say! Mmmmmm-uuuaaaah
Say! Mmmmmm--uuuaaaah


Monday night at operation control
I sat facing rows of monitor mountains
Mind control
Life control
Operation mind control

My first is in car
I'm easily bought, but still always short

[Fly that over space beam]

And round my way the people still do say
Ridd-ler
Ridd-ler
And round these parts the people still impart
Riddler!

My second is in..

Zoooooooom!

Say! Mmmmmm

And round my way the people still do say

Round my way the people still do say

And round these parts the people still exclaim
Ridd-ler

And even now kids round our place say

SHOULDER PADS 2# 

Knew I was right all along
Rock to Them, a Talking Heads album
Superhero in harlequin kecks
Dim-wit lecture, half read

Was I - victim in clown hat?
Was I - nearly turned

Then my powers did return....

Watch out!
Makers of fads

It's MES in shoulder pads

My powers none
Powers, said Batman

Said a twisted chill, flashes pan
It's MES in shoulder pads

Big fit deal for mothers of fads
It's MES in shoulder pads

You'd better
Line that bottom line
Against that different clan

Holding ankles
Rotten kecks
It's MES in shoulder pads


AUTO TECH PILOT 

Last night I heard 3 real loud ricochets
From the police tech center at the top of my street
And then the morning after, brass band in unison
Jumping, shouting, all 3000
Meanwhile I've been broke in twice
And had a maniac at door, swearing, 12:05 AM


And I really think this computer thing is getting out of hand
And I think this tech pilot isn't going to land
Three quarters of mail destined for beer
Time to put an end, to the extend
All the bump men
Time we cake this
Compute garbage in, garbage out
And time to put a cap on this
With a brain, nice habit
And I'm thinkin of...


(Track is deserted
All securities run forth of the perverted)


Isn't gonna land
On its purgatory band
Auto tech pilot
Isn't gonna land
Jet isn't gonna land
Troll the instant pilot
Auto tech pilot
Isn't gonna land


HEY! LUCIANI 

Aborteum.
I said Luciani
The future's here today
I said Hey Luciani
Pope of three three days

They made out you were are an ultra nut
And had no time for your Christianity
You paid with your life for their treachery
The future's here today
The future's here to stay
Luciani

Hey Luciani
Jesus has gone away
I said Hey Luciani
Meet the Church, Bank, S.A. [1]

They said you were of peasant stock
And one day the curia murdered you
Your hermeneutics are through
And on that fruited plain
The corporate bishop's graze
Exit church of poverty and pain
The future's here today
The future's here to stay

Hey Luciani
A pop star in your cell
I said Hey Luciani
A Polish son of Hell

You were the first John Paul I
How is it your 'Christian' is gone?
Can you see it from your grave?
The TV snow-storm on top,
The brass Holy Grail
Imitation for sale
The future's here today
Luciani

And all the cowls are black
On an inquisition rack
The future's here today
The future's here to stay
Luciani

CARRY BAG MAN 

I'm in love with the Carrier Bag Man
I love the Carrier Bag Man X2
Carrier bags strewn all around the room
Ah, the Carrier Bag Man-- I am him
Coz I am the Carrier Bag Man -- I am the carrier bag man


I've no time to sit comfortable down
But I still need armchairs round my home
To put carrier bags on


I am the Carrier Bag Man
Carry a bag man!


I don't make waves, I hide bags in graves
No cash is earned straight nowadays anyways
Please all you onlookers understand
So make gangway for Carrier Bag Man


I am Carrier Bag Man


[megaphone rant]


When in town I keep head down
Kneel on the croft when the mariah comes round
Fat-assed workmen, I scurry around
There's few good places to hide bags behind


Coz I am Carrier Bag Man.
Carry a bag man!


GET A HOTEL 

Get a hotel today. 
Go get a hotel today. 
Go get a hotel today. 
Before the idea slips away, 
Get a hotel. 
Go get a hotel today. 
That was the first question raised, 
There was a question raised. 
Get a hotel 
Wanna get in (x2) 
But this is not the place to bring it up
Go get a hotel today(x2) 
Before the bike siren calls 
Times running 
Like butter dissolving 
Times running, time dissolving, 
Times running melting 
Times running passing 
Its running passing. 
Get a hotel today (x2) 
She says get a hotel 
Ne'er do well 
Get a hotel (x2) 
Before the bike siren calls 
And the horn siren yells 
It says 
Get a hotel (x2) 
You better 
Go get a hotel today (x2) 
Times running 
Times running passing 
Times running, 
Times running, 
It's running it's passing 
Like butter melting 
Times running, passing, it's running passing 
Like flesh cut melting 
It's running it's passing times running it's passing dissolving,
I was eating gravel when two cars put in. (x2) 
Headlights dousing, 
Broken warehouse; 
I just got out 
Dirt inhaled
The cinders told me, 
Ya shoulda got a hotel. 
Go get a hotel today. x2 
Before the bike siren calls. 
And the blood-curdlers yell. 
Go get a hotel today. 
All thugs use the Burton ploy; 
The Lord acts 
Around my appeal. 
He says get a hotel. 
Shoulda! 
Go get a hotel today. 
Get a hotel. 
A little voice yells
should of got a hotel. 
Get a hotel. 
Go a hotel today.
Get a hotel, 
Get a hotel. 


VICTORIA 

It was bad, called obscene 
And the rich were so mean 
Stately homes for the Lords 
Golden lawns, village green
Victoria was my queen

Victoria, Victoria, Victoria

I was born, lucky me 
In the land that I love 
Though I'm poor, I am free 
When I go I shall fight 
For this land I willl die 
Let her sun never set on

Victoria, Victoria, Victoria

Canada to India 
Australia to Cornwall 
Singapore to Hong Kong 
From the West to the East 
From the rich to the poor 
Victoria loved them all

Victoria, Victoria, Victoria


ATHLETE CURED 

Look under
Look under


From the hotbed of creation
in dreamstate.
The cure, bulletin, zeitung
Was in no pill.
Look under.
The cure was in no pill.


The German athletic star was continually ill.
For months doctors were puzzled.
The star would complain of the smell in his room.
On visiting him this was found to be true.
An odor resembling hot-dogs permeated the whole bedroom.


A solution was only discovered by my closely
watching his brother Gert.
Gert was handsome, well-meaning,  but slightly a careless type.
Not malicious, I hope you understand and grasp.
No chance.


But on returning from his clerical job, Gert 
would park his Volkswagen at the end of the day
willy-nilly in the driveway, usually the wrong way round,
so that the exhaust fumes would flow upwards right through
the open windows of the athletic star's upstairs bedroom.
(carburettor)

I also discovered that Gert would turn his engine
over for up to an hour. I don't know why.
Citizens in my street are also
partial to this.


Look under.
The cure was in no pill.


Obtaining a new parking space for Gert's motor-car, athletic star soon
recovered.
Unfortunately, this being East Germany,
Gert patriotically volunteered to be sent on a labor
beautification course of the countryside north-west of Dresden.
And never seen again.
And never seen again.


Look under.
The cure was in no pill.
Had to look under the window sill.
The window sill.


Look under.
The cure was in no pill.
Had to look under the window sill.
The window sill.


From certain facts you have to go on and further
and often it is better to go around or look under.

IN THESE TIMES 

A flat season - vision gone
Picture frame it, and say so long;
My Aqua-cat is where it's at and new to mammal range
Buy you know it would never suit, territories Alpine


In These TIMES - Meeowww
In These Times - Fishcat Mother
In This Time - Spectral Filter
In These Times - A Feline Nutter


In these times;


A Man down South, he did go out and he did kill fifteen
What the papers could not grasp or work out, was his life
in a Flea brain;


In These Times - Universal Tepid
In These Times - Stagnant Mind
In This Time - And in these times
These Times - They're both the same


Diluted Jesuits pour out of mutual walkmans
From Elland Road to Venice Pensions and down
the Autobahns;


In This Time - If That's it I'm leaving
In These Times - Leave this planet fast
In These Times - It affects my sleeping
In This Time - My dreams are one to miss
Ones to be avoiding
In times like this


I often hope in days ahead my gossamer front gates,
will keep out the trash in which my psychic streets' emershed;


In These Times - Spectral Filter
In These Times - In Your Midst
In These Times - This song's a belter
In This Time - For times like this


In These Times - I picture framed pre-teen rap gangs,
with alsatians, Scapa flow steel became
inexpensive


A first season - vision gone
Picture frame it - and say so long
They say 'Give up Buster' - Cram it down
But I grow stronger, and break their Midszzzzzzzz


THE STEAK PLACE 

Head down 
Head down 
Head, head, head down.

Fool of the Commonwealth drove down there, 
Down turnpike; 
Desperate for food desperate for respite.

The steak place. 
The steak place

Cheap carpet lines the way 
Aluminium tack door handles 
Candelabra lions head 
Via butchers display too.

The steak place (x2) 

Via a carcass row
Things are brought forward and eaten, 
I see the corners filled with hitmen, 
Two young lawyers they are whispering, in

The steak place (x2)

I wanna stay here, 
I don't wanna go anywhere, 
I could remain here,

Head down 
Head down 
Head down 
Head, head, head down
The steak place (x2)

I'd stop the automation, 
I'd sit behind dusty lace, 
I have a word with hitmen, 
I give off a beatific face. 

The steak place (x2)
From New York City run screaming, 
Into New England states, 
Combined a man not should have to do this, 
A man should not use his fist in

The steak place.
The steak place. 

I wanna stay here, 
I don't wanna go anywhere, 
I shall remain here. 

(Bad song)


BREMEN NACHT 

Something happened in Bremen, I know
Something I don't want to
Something under the ceiling muttered
Something in its steel shutters


Underlining my usual timing
Aligning casual set-list
And it aligned?
Knowing where right room is
I was more than usual pissed

Was first ashamed at bruise on wrist
Was then annoyed at skin-patch on back
Then I did myself acquit
On Bremen Nacht

Ich leave real quick das Bremen Nacht

Ich rausum mach aus bremen nacht

Ich rausum mach das bremen nacht

Ic-raus-Mach-Schnell aus das bremen nicht

Ich-aus Schnell mach sas bremen nacht

Ich Mach Schnell pack und aus das bremen nacht


Ich raus schnell mach von bremen nacht [1]

The child's four-fingered bruises on my hip
Meant I had been one day possessed

Right through Bremen Nacht
Right on to Bremen Tag
The sunlit Bremen day
By Tonsillitis size train station Hof
Could only in one way fail to impress
This on drinks door I did lay
I had been one day possessed


Ich rausum mach aus bremen nacht


Thank God skin-patch is nearly gone
And the impress of fingers dead
Have disappeared and left me alone

That's one night I didna put jackboots on
Don't want to end reflection
It's still there, though I am gone

And it will be a long long long time gone
before my spirit will in accident
go back and come from Bremen Nacht
go back and come from Bremen Nacht


OSWALD DEFENSE LAWYER 

How could he cope with the flashing-by past [/flash in my past]?
Through my vid-earphone amp I had to tap
I relate the tract
Oswald Defense Lawyer


Oswald Defense Lawyer
Embraces the scruffed corpse [1] of the Mark Twain
Oswald Defense Lawyer


How do you think that jury made up of putrid mass
Embraced theory of triangle bullet lines
Turning in circles twice,
Then incredible, marvelous, exiting back of mind?
And Oswald's Defense Lawyer
Embraces scruffed corpse of Mark Twain
Oswald Defense Lawyer
Embraces scruffed corpse of Walt Whitman
Oswald Defense Lawyer
Embraces the scruffed corpse of Mark Twain


Decent lawyer fishes in buckskin hat
Raccoons drown beneath his embarking mass
When he sees CIA shit flying over head fast
Goody goody looks up
In cloudless sky enhancing theory of zig-zag bulletline
Oswald Defense Lawyer
Embraces the scruffed corpse of the Mark Twain


He's liberal and insane,
He caught the good news horse
His opposite is vain
The cardboard fake in the witness stand
He's got an interview in Spin magazine
He loves the magazine
His mouth is in his brain
The prosecution lawyer
Turns himself to butter
Oswald Defense Lawyer


Oswald Defense Lawyer
Embraces the scruffed corpse of Walt Whitman
Cheap rifle photo touched up
Drawn on sky
Oswald's head added on a commie tie
While Oswald Defense Lawyer
Embraces the scuffed corpse of Mark Twain

And with a pernicious refrain
You return and say the same
Give it to me baby one more time X5
You forever say
Tuff life yeah baby!
Tuff life yeah baby!


GUEST INFORMANT 

Baghdad/Space Cog/Analyst [1]
You'll never guess who informed
It was Craig and Steve
The stool pigeons, cha-cha-cha-cha...


Guest informant, guest informant
Guest informant, guest informant
I followed the colonel to the cheap hotel,
I tapped the beds
I wired the phones as well,
Colonel Boggs Maroley was his mantle
Had not counted on
I had not counted on
Guest Informant, guest informant


I've been split on, I've been touted on,
I had not counted on Guest Informant


In the burning scorch of another Sunday over
The miserable Scottish hotel,
Resembled a Genesis or Marillion, 1973 LP cover
All the hotel staff had been dismissed,
It was me, the Hoover, and the O. A. P.s 
Asked: Could he turn killer?
Thought: could I kill him?
Pondered: Or is he itinerant?
But I guess he's just a cog analyst
Guest informant, guest informant


Baghdad/Space Cog/Analyst.


I could not comprehend, I could not understand
Had not counted on, I had not counted all
Guest informant, guest informant
I've been split by a first-grade moron
And I had not counted on, I had not counted on
Guest informant, guest informant
Guest informant, guest informant
I've been let down, by a first-grade moron
And I could not comprehend 
Had not counted on
Guest informant, guest informant


TWISTER 

The magnificent structure straddled the river
As I dictated my autobiography to my biographer
When I heard this tune
My title was "Renegade Genius"
But was interrupted much too soon
Was interrupted much too soon
I received this line

Twister

From me in Hampstead he received a letter
I headed it "Dear Twister"
Up from West Hampstead I visited Keswick
On permission from the guard
I begun like this but could not continue it
When I heard this tune
(It begun like this but could not continue it)
My ears were burned
By this tune
My head swooned
By this tune

Twister

The train from London on day of lunacy
Was packed with innocents
Children tended by walkman'd parents
Cretins auditioning
For non-existent parts on TV One
The train was a tube
Within the crushing beauty of the countryside
On the London-Keswick run

THERE'S A GHOST IN MY HOUSE 

There's a ghost in my house
The ghost of your memory
The ghost of the love that was took from me

Our love used to be
Only shadows in the past I see
Times can't seem to've erased
The vision of your smiling face

Dead flowers I sent thee
I can't get over ye

There's a ghost in my house
I can't hide (ghost in my house)
For the ghost of your love is inside (ghost in my house)
Keeps on haunting me (ghost in my house)
Just keeps on becalling me (ghost in my house)

Down in my tea cup [1]
I see your face looking up
Sitting in my easy chair
I feel your fingers running through my hair

Though we're far apart
Your spectre's in my heart

There's a ghost in my house
I can't hide (ghost in my house)
For the ghost of your love is inside (ghost in my house)
Keeps on haunting me (ghost in my house)
Still just a part of me (ghost in my house)

By the way I hang my head
You can see I'm afraid
Thought my heart knows you're gone
My mind keeps rolling on

There's a ghost in my house
I can't hide

In my house I am helpless
[?] practice superstitious

I hear footsteps on the stairs
I know there's no-one there
Keeps on haunting me
Keeps on haunting me

There's a ghost in my house
A ghost of your memory
A ghost of the love that was took from me

Ghost in my house (to fade)

HIT THE NORTH 

Hit the North
My Cat says eeeee-ack
Hit the North
95% of [hayseeds or corn-pone], guaranteed
Computers infest the hotels
Cops can't catch criminals
But what the heck, they're not too bad, they talk to God

Religioussssss
Hit the North
Manacled to the city, manacled to the city
All estate agents alive yell down nights in hysterical breath
Those Northern lights... so pretty
Those big big big wide streets
Those useless MPs
Savages...
Hit the North (Manacled to the system)


From the back third eye psyche, the reflected mirror of delirium,
Eastender and Victoria's lager, the induced call, mysterious,
comes
forth - Hit the North
(Savages)
Hit the North

DOG IS LIFE/JERUSALEM 

You don't see rabbits being walked down the street
And you don't see many cats on leads
Dogs pet dogs dogs rapacious wet dogs
Owner of dogs slow-witted dog owner
Owner of rabid dog saving fare for tunnel
Euro-dream of civil, civil liberation for dogs
Society secret society inevitable nightmare
Of drift dog pet dogs street bullshit
Dog shit baby bit ass-lick dog mirror
Dead tiger shot and checked out by dog
Big tea-chest-fucker dog
Black collar sends East German refugee back switch and crap pathetic
Of earth-like lousy dog role model for infidel doghouse continent
Mutt citadel dog-eye mirror hypnotic school slaver and learn
Rot from dog on grass and over nervous delicate dog
Detracts light from indiscrepant non-dog-lover
Dog pet dog come home to ya
Come home we'll talk shit to ya
Dog the pet-owner-owner  blistered hanging there death dog
Plato of the human example and copier dogmaster pet mourner
Dog is life

And did those feet in ancient times,
Walk upon mountains green?
And was the holy Lamb of God,
On England's pleasant pastures seen?

And did the Countenance Divine,
Shine forth on clouded hills?
And was Jerusalem 
In the dark Satanic Mills? [1]

Jerusalem

It was the fault of the government
I was walking down the street
When I tripped up on a discarded banana skin
And on my way down I caught the side of my head
On a protruding brick chip
It was the government's fault
It was the fault of the government
I was very let down with the budget
I was expecting a one million quid handout
I was very disappointed
It was the government's fault
It was the fault of the government

I became a semi-artistic type person
And I didn't have a pen
And I didn't have a condom
It was the fault of the government
I think I'll emigrate to Sweden or Poland
And get looked after properly by government

Jerusalem

Bring Bow of burning gold:
Bring Arrows of desire:
Bring me Spear: O clouds unfold!

And though I rest from Mental Fight,
And though sword sleeps in hand
I will not rest til Jerusalem is built

In Englands green and pleasant Land.


KURIOUS ORANJ 

Pained and intense, man
They were inquiring.
They were curious orange...
They rode over peasants like you, they rode over peasants like you,
And their horses loved them too, and their horses loved them too.
They Were Kurious Orange. They Were Curious Orange.
They built the world as we know it, all the systems you traverse.
Rode slipshod over all dumbshits.
They were curious orange...

They freed the Blacks too.
They built church in one day, man,
Amish
They were curious orange...
Their clothes were cool.
Paved way for atom bomb--didn't know.

They made Hitler laugh in pain.
They sent missionary girls to Arab states, and the sun-baked men
did drool.
They were curious orange...

They made Hitler laugh in pain.
They turned Napoleon over and didn't know.
They invented birth control
They were invulnerable to cool.

They were beyond Ooobenblief
They were primo efficient to a man.
They were Stuyvestant smoking.
They were the Reformation spring
And everybody in the world turned Reformation blue.
They were invulnerable to cool
And everybody in the world...
And they were inquiring.
They were positively deranged and they were curious orange.
They were curious orange...

WRONG PLACE, RIGHT TIME 

Wrong place right time
I used to think I could do what I wanted to
Right time for me alone
Walk the streets of complete full homes

Wrong place, but I'm bound
To stick with what I intend to see through
See you, in wrong place
Right time but there's miles in between

I keep on knocking but there's no bugger in
I have to sing gothic, boo hoo

See me, a new reign
A new reign not to be forgotten
Right place, right time
Right time and Britain is mine
That day, on way
And all peasants will know Oranj

Peasants smile: big shine
Very happy under rule of Oranj
You can whine under rule of Oranj

Mike Clarke: sez I bastard
He is deranged, I am William of Oranj
Go insane in Holland!
I can't wait to taste anthrax turf again
Big Wren: homage Oranj
I an Oranj I have paid dues to the one
Who's #1 in heaven
As in Heaven so in Britain
(By Oranj I am Oranj I am one)

Can't dance can't sing
Cursed forever is William of Oranj
Can't dance can't sing
Cursed forever is William of Oranj
Can't dance can't sing
Cursed forever is William of Oranj
Can't dance can't sing
Cursed forever is William of Oranj

VAN PLAGUE? 

From over the ocean came plague
Via the ocean - plague came
Plague came & we're not the same
All around is pure tension
Beliefs and tears now & again
From where has this great sadness came
From sou'west flew plague
From northwest plague came

I laughed at chicks with frustration
Fear of plague has sent us home
For love at least of our dear mum
Father takes it in his stride
Says 'back in the closet, son'
Was it ocean brought the plague?
Over the ocean came plague

Plague came, nothing is the same
All there is is death and pain
Hearts now broken on our beach
[Love disolved as they do up]
Love dissolved by Haitian sun
Did South Atlantic bring plague?
What evil ocean brought plague?

Plague flew up from an ocean
From satan's tree and his baboon
A body's waste 'neath a gibbous moon
Rancid kid drowned in lagoon
From still blue ocean came plague
From Caribbean plague came

Plague came in that Satan made
And our friends became deranged
Secret glamrock, gleeful hat
We stock Far Corporation
Glamrock family leisure zone

It was an evil plague

They sparked up and they built the boat
Put wind in its grim sail
Bringing plague and our peril
Bringing plague and our peril

Could only in one way fail to depress

But I will be a long long time gone
But my spirit will in accident
Go back and come from Bremen Nacht

PINBALL MACHINE 

I'm an old road-hog
I drove a big truck
Shot the pinball machine, but it brought me bad luck.
If oceans was whiskey and I was a dove
I'd dive into it and never come up.
I wish they'd outlaw them old pinball machines
Many weeks they have caused me to live on sardines.

Last time I called my wife on the phone,
The first thing she said was "John, can you come home?
I got a lot of lodgers and they've got to go."
I said "I'll see you when I get back from the depot."

She said "John, you know I love you, I wish you wouldn't go
Send your babies some money. They're hungry and cold."
The last thing she said, and then she hung up, was
"John you gave up my loving to drive an old truck."

I made my trip up to the depot
I was gone two months cause I shot up my dough
When I got home my family was gone
The best friend I had rung my telephone.
He said "John, I guess you wonder 'bout your babies and wife...
Pneumonia got your babies and your wife took her life."
I've lost all my friends, can't sleep for bad dreams
I dream about a old truck and a pinball machine.

I never will forget the last words that old man said:
"Oh Lord, if I could live my life over,"
And then he fell dead, the victim of an old truck.

He was a clean-cut young man at the age of nineteen,
But now he's in his grave,
The victim of an old truck
And a pinball machine.


H.O.W. 

I can treat you to visit to coastal pillboxes
I like to delve in destruction, lust and debauches
And I am the one who stamps on all ages
From 16 to 40, over and under
I'm monolithic, and the black ice on the corner

Hiss...hiss...hiss

As all is as one, as all damp on all stone
I hold all time and can induce at once
Jet trains, lead paint, stamps on border forms
Misread Easter Island, put butter on plague style
Spin complete revolutions and not bat an eyelid
And alter tree-rings so that what you are after
You will not ever find with a surfeit of lumber
And make you imagine from hunger
Bread trees spinning, dripping with butter
Just 6 inches higher than your upstretched middle finger

History of the...

I place minute dust in your microchip vessels
For daring to think all science is immortal
I am the one who'll strike you down at once
For stretching time-bracket, and assuming that what is
Can be maladjusted. A rigid adoption
Of codes you had concocted
I can treat you to visit to coastal pillboxes
And show you all hideous microscope thingies
And Hovis set-up in London's psoriasis

Stockings, jokings, 1780's

History of the wo...

From 16 to 40, over and under

SQUID LAW 

Good man, lend a hand
Help me to deal with some scum
Who are only in their late teens
But I hate their existence
They think 3 on 1
A normal thing
Network 7 encouraged them
But tonight they picked the wrong man

Squid Lord
Revenge
Vast
Just
His intelligence
Spreads

[Extra verse on Peel session:

Number One squat with grey turnup jeans
Stuck up white hairstyle
Obviously sheep shag mill town
Squid lord revenge
Just his intelligence vast]

The second one is a streak of piss
Leave me alone with him
His blindness will be fun
But it won't make a difference

Squid Lord
Vast
Just
His intelligence

The third one stood behind
Held my arms
But in the hospital
His bed will be in a draught
A geriatric germ-well
I curse his family and wish them poor
But he'll have time to dwell
On squid revenge, cooped-up
In 3 months of pure Hell

Squid Lord
Vast
Just
His tentacles
Spread

Good man, lend a hand
Help me clear this mess
Give me back the law it took from my life
Give me back the pride of my class
This scum are just a morass

Squid Lord
Revenge
Vast
Just
His intelligence


ELF PREFIX 

The chief elf Norman said
Gutter sweat
Splendid droplets on strings
His toes were cloven
His teeth were squirly and pointy
Knee cups curly
Ding click rings on ears
Norman jumped about
On all four corners
Norman twirled around his golden thrones
Whitewall tyres were a lifetime from his thoughts


CRUISER'S CREEK INTRO. [by Bill Grundy] 

I have never seen five thousand yobbos in my life
I promise you I'm only going to speak to you now
For a few seconds
But a bit later I'm going to tell you
About how I made the fortune of punk rock
Since I think that music starts with Johann Sebastian Bach
And ends with Franz Schubert
You're going to have to listen a bit later
About my interview on television
The first they'd ever had
Bad language
See you later
Enjoy yourselves

SING HARPY 

The harpy was the tops
Whose hair contained some red
Thin white skeleton
Just too good in bed.

He mother from the circus
Put her on Junior Show Time
Her father was much worse
Can't put why in this line

And in the little village
She was without malice
She left the moors behind her
And the beige heather
Packed her placky bag
With blocks of brown cannabis.

She took a lousy Wednesday
Turned it into cold Spring
She got taller by the minute
She could sell you anything

And the morning after
I was quite astonished
She gripped me like a hawk
Her talons were quite famished

Ascend harpy
Sing harpy
Descend harpy
Give me harpy

BILL IS DEAD 

Last week after "Dynasty"
I had crows feet under my eyes
Paid two days for getting high

Freezing
Wheezing
Got pasted in a bar
I hope I've got the number

These are finest times of my life
This is the greatest time of my life
This is the greatest time of my life
These are the biggest times of my life

But just lately seeing you
I rise a.m. off pink sheets
I am renewed
I am aglow
Red brick and green is the streets
You dressed today as if for riding school
Your legs are so cool
Came twice
You thrice

These are the greatest times of my life

Everybody's got a bag of his own 
Everybody's talking about places

And good things come after 
Just follow the paths along

That man is your teacher 
No need to be alarmed

Sounds so strange, nobody sleeps 
I met a little man on the corner 
Waving a flag and making a speech

Coffee each morning 
Don't park or, nor warning 
They tow your machine away 
There's so much confusion 
That's built on illusion 
What's making the music play?

ARMS CONTROL POSEUR 

Death of a sense of humour
'N death of sense
How do you recover from this?

What do you fear?
Being found out
Then why do you always give yourself away?

What do you want to do?
Hide
Then why go out and make an exhibition of yourself?

What do you seek?
Oblivion
And drugs walk the streets

What you want to be able to do 
is worst advice
Louse given in largesse

Arms control 
Arms control poseur
Arms control

Parliment connives a diseased access company
There's nothing much I can do about this
So I drink in recline with an acquaintance, sound

Spouse is talking on the phone
To well-armed arms control poseur

Arms control poseur

I found my home
I made a calendar that wasn't there
To find whether it was the first of December
Or not

Armed control poseur
In pity and envy
Dragged from the streets
I quite very very much enjoyed
His jovial lies
Lying

Arms control poseur

Arms control poseur
Arms control poseur

Sports car interior
Encrusted with bluebottles
Armoured car interior 
Encrusted with bluebottles
I even stoop to an icy vodka
As I feel the inevitable
battle creep nearer and nearer
Chip! Chip!
Arms control poseur

Arms control poseur

HILARY 

Hilary
Where's the sixty quid you borrowed off me for the gas? 
I won't give you a kiss
Hilary
Hey Hilary

'New Faces' on Saturday at six
Brought you back to me

Hilary

I'm sure it was you in the new Audi
Outside Sainsbury's

Hilary

Remember when you needed three caps of speed
To get out of bed
And now you're on ecstasy

Hilary

With your daft African pop
And that wine you call bull's blood

Hilary

I thank the lord that you still don't live next to me

Hilary

Just setting down.

THE LITTLEST REBEL 

There's loads of people
Trying to suss out the scene
Sniffing about and sticking
Their noses in
Rebel
But she was the littlest rebel

Blue suit with nylon weave
She wears jet black high heels
She throws planks down the well
She's the littlest rebel
Rebel
But she was the littlest rebel

She consigns them all to hell 
She's the littlest rebel

Her tormentors jet past in Nissans
She says are those cars?
Are those shoes?

She consigns them all to hell
She's the littlest rebel
Hips like Shirley Temple
She's the littlest rebel
And she doesn't kiss and tell
She's the littlest rebel
Rebel
But she was the littlest rebel

A sophisticate plays truant
She's the littlest rebel
And she doesn't kiss and tell
Cause she's the littlest rebel
Well she's the littlest rebel
Rebel
And she was the littlest rebel


BRITISH PEOPLE IN HOT WEATHER 

Fill green envelopes and send them to ya
On train ride, read Marx tracts
Play walkmans loud behind ya
Demonstrate on Oxford Street
About what the Hell they couldn't tell ya
British people in hot weather
Have a heart-to-heart with your sister
People in shorts drunk before ya
Beached whale in Wapping
His armpit hairs are sprouting
Serpentine ah.... Serpentine grrr...
British people in hot weather

Press hot houses waste tree statements
Compare your pearls before the King of Monks
I'm telling ya, oh
Do they know they can get cancer?
Designer tramp goes grrr...
Looking jolly from Stoke
As he walks through and makes up
Titles like this, to order
They're well off their trolley
Smoking like a chimney
Bespectacled stare-out
British people in hot weather

I was a candidate for club 18-30
but I've been through all that shit before
British people in hot weather
That's it, I'm looking straight for the car
If that's how you feel, let's go
British people in hot weather


AND THEREIN... 

You know by now the Lord lays hard trails
When you see that man outside in the bucketing rain
You picture it in your cozy home.

You think you've blown a fuse,
Don't know how to react
You don't know where it's at.

And therein lies the difference, and therein.... (x3)

They always say it comes in three and fours
And that it never rains, it just pours...

You think it's your fault
And you curse the moon
You go to the saloon

And therein lies the difference, and therein... (x3)

He turned the water into wine
And he insisted that we eat swine

And that's the sum of it
Why don't you come to grips?
Just take or leave it.

And therein lies the difference, and therein...

POPCORN DOUBLE FEATURE 

Everybody's going through changes
Everybody's got a bag of his own 
Everybody's talking about places 
That can only be found in the greater unknown
People are dying 
The babies are crying 
Don't nobody care at all? 
There's love and disaster 
And good things come after 
Just follow the paths along

Popcorn double feature
The whole world's a funny farm
That man is your teacher 
No need to be alarmed

Music's coming out of the woodwork
Sounds so strange, nobody sleeps 
I met a little man on the corner 
Waving a flag and making a speech

Coffee each morning 
Don't park or, no warning
They tow your machine away 
There's so much confusion 
That's built on illusion 
What's making the music play

Popcorn double feature 
The whole world's a funny farm 
That man is your teacher 
No need to be alarmed 
NOT MUCH

Coffee each morning 
No popcorn a-warning 
They tow your machine away
There's love and disaster 
But good things come after
What's making the music play

ARMS CONTROL POSEUR 

Death of a sense of humour
'N death of sense
How do you recover from this?

What do you fear?
Being found out
Then why do you always give yourself away?

What do you want to do?
Hide
Then why go out and make an exhibition of yourself?

What do you seek?
Oblivion
And drugs off the streets

What you want to be able to do 
is worst advice
Louts give it in largesse

Arms control 
Arms control poseur
Arms control

Parliment connives a diseased access company
There's nothing much I can do about this
So I drink and recline with an acquaintance, sound

Spouse is talking on the phone
To well-armed armed control poseur

Arms control poseur

I found my home
I made a calendar that wasn't there
To find whether it was the first of December
Or not

Dragged from the streets
I quite very very much enjoyed
His jovial lies
Lying

BUTTERFLIES 4 BRAINS 

Got a reason to live, got a reason
For brains, butterflies for brains

That's it
Whizz bang butterflies for brains
She's got
Whizz bang butterflies for brains

Would walk ten country miles
In a fat person's moccasin
Butterflies for brains

The four of us are dying
I'm very concerned about school buildings
Got a reason to live, got black-cloud aura

She's got....
Here it is....

ZANDRA 

Zandra
C'mon c'mon c'mon just pack it in

Zandra
Give it up Zandra
Everybody you love
Is covered in loot

The world is [Old Nick/monodic]
It is not your oyster
You cannot collate it
So give up that [dope/dumb] shit

Hello Zandra
From the planet Redundra

I'm stressed out
I'm talked out



SO WHAT ABOUT IT? 

Fall advice!
Fall advice!
Fall advice!
Fall advice!

The Year Number 1
Has gone and turned 
Into Year of Bomb
TV wars 24 hours
But it happens
Fall advice!

Shaking my bones down the M14
Passenger seat gripped tight
And seriously
I cannot sleep
But I'm happy
I cannot eat
So what about it?

It happens
It happens
It happens
Fall advice!

The works down the drain
And interest never wanes
So what about it?

Fall advice!
Yak! Yak! Yak!
Some are born to life
Some are born depressed
About it
Fall advice!
To parties underground
You're driving around in lake districts
You're stepping around
It doesn't matter to me
Cause it happens
It's magic
So what about it?


IDIOT JOY SHOWLAND 

Idiot groups with no shape or form
Out of their heads on a quid of blow
The shapeless kecks [1] flapping up a storm
Look at what they are: a pack of worms

Idiot Joy Showland

The nylon leaves are falling
From the twisted shell of your cranium
Your mystic jump suits cannot hide
Your competitive plagiarism

Idiot Joy Showland

Freddie and the Dreamers, come on up
Hey you imitators, come on up
Hey little singer, come on up
Show us your house and
Show us your cock
The working class has been shafted
So what the fuck you sneering at?
Your prerogative in life it seems
Is living out an ad man's dream

Idiot Joy Showland

California has Disneyland
And Blackpool has a Funland
And Flanders had no man's land
This place idiot show bands

Idiot Joy Showland

And now microcosms come and go
And it's amazing what they show
Your sportsmen's tears are laudanum
Idiot Joy Showland

The locusts are all queuing in
For Idiot Joy Showland
Idiot Joy



EDINBURGH MAN 

It's springtime but I still miss the streets at dawn
And in the morning walking your bridges home
As I sit and stare at all of England's souls
I tell you something
I wish I was in Edinburgh

I don't mind being by myself
Don't wanta be anywhere else
Just wanna be in Edinburgh
I wish I was an Edinburgh man

You can leave me on the shelf
I'm an Edinburgh man myself
I will always give you help

It's summertime but I still miss your skies so clear
Sitting and staring on a beach somewhere
I'll tell you something
I wish I was in Edinburgh

Don't give a toss about private wealth
And history just repeats itself
Keep me away from the Festival
And just give me a warm quarter-gill [1]

They say you project yourself
But I'm an Edinburgh man myself

It's wintertime and i still see the cobble stones
Clacking over your streets at dawn
I was really poor since I left Edinburgh

I'm OK just by myself
Cause our miserable king won't protect us from ourselves
How I wish I was in Edinburgh
How I wish I was in Edinburgh

I was always in good health
I'm an Edinburgh man myself
I will always give you help
I'm an Edinburgh man myself



PITTSVILLE DIREKT 

No current is waned
Where it wants to go
Some are only happy
In the throes
Of bitter arguments
Ready and packed
To ride there by train ride
By plane ride
By walking
Or from the insides

I can't deal with Pittsville Direkt
I don't wanna go to Pittsville Direkt
No no no Pittsville Direkt
Yes yes yes Pittsville Direkt

Stood off the train platform
Crushed cig in cup
FDA regulation state
Boarded at gate
Plane rides

I can't deal with Pittsville Direkt
I don't wanna trip to Pittsville Direkt
No love lost in Pittsville Direkt

And meanwhile
From New York to Skegness [1]
They don't ask your telephone silk

I don't wanna go to Pittsville Direckt
No no no no Pittsville Direkt
Please don't please Pittsville Direkt
Many a jest in Pittsville Direkt

By planeride
By trainride
What are they doing to Bournemouth City Park West?
Why have they got those masks on?

I wanna exit Pittsville Direkt
I'm correct about Pittsville Direkt
The citizens of Pittsville Direkt
Will be out scaring ghosts
Around midnight

Ride out to where the planets roam
Drive carefully! Mother-to-be on board

Boarding now from Pittsville Direkt

HIGH TENSION LINE 

High tension line, step down

Jeanette Fletcher is strange but not in a horrible way
And Michelle Spencer is this tight
Come and hear her today
And see 40-year olds in multicoloured shirts
It never used to concern me
But now it's making me say

High tension line, step down

Buying houses and doing them up far far away
Got at my shoulder CDTI and behind me TDK
You have to go far for the simple and unadorned
And please excuse my words, wandering

High tension line, step down

At my feet CDTI breakdown
And I pick up the phone, no-one
And am far too far fast for sampling
Just spend my time avoiding

High tension line, step down

Life is nothing more than a disposable
Facial tissue in a brass bin and spawn
Take it out, I notice face imprint
And please excuse my words, I'm wandering

High tension line, step down


THE WAR AGAINST INTELLIGENCE 

The war against Intelligence
War versus Intelligence
Notebooks out plagiarists
War Against Intelligence

War versus Intelligence
They got a lot of debris yesterday
They stuck out its golden horns
And volunteered its essence
War Against Intelligence

Hey pseud!
Why did you defect to the other side?
Hey dude!
Give the info a rest and use your mind
Dancing with your Dada mates [Dad and mates] in the corner
You're such a bloody fool
You think your haircut is distinguished
When it's a blot on the English landscape

Hey dude!
Get your mental bones right outta here!
You!
It's beyond your capability
Hey git!
In the league of mental short-arse
And you will never recompense
For your war versus intelligence
War versus Intelligence
War Against Intelligence

Hey dude!


SHIFT-WORK 

She's ten to five
But I'm shiftwork
And my woman alive
Shiftwork

Shiftwork

I thought shiftwork would work
But it's good as broken us apart

Lights flash over me 
Twenty-four hour bulb
I'm just home for tea 
But she's in work mode

Shiftwork

Shiftwork

And they will shake you by the hands 
For shiftwork 
But being abandoned by your woman 
Is the price for shiftwork

Shiftwork

Shiftwork

Shiftwork

Shiftwork, you let me down 
Gave me a hard heart 
You just cracked my mind 
You split us apart 
Shiftwork

Shiftwork

Shiftwork

Raise your wages per year one grand
By shiftwork 
But I can see me go, go, going from this land
Because of shiftwork

Shiftwork

I don't give her a chance 
She gets the the morning rant
Gets in at eleven 
Doing overtime
I'm going out at the time 
Just to hang out with a woman who was my...

Shiftwork

She was ten to five 
But I'm shiftwork 
And that woman that once was mine 
It's just shiftwork

Shiftwork

Shiftwork

Now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now 
Shiftwork 
Now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now 
Shiftwork 
Now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now 
Shiftwork 
Now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now

YOU HAVEN'T FOUND IT YET 

You haven't found it yet,
Haven't found it yet.

Look at the glass, turn your head
You haven't found it yet.
Moving down the lane inside
It's flashy Camden Town
It's that London lyric again
You haven't found it yet.

Impulses crowd your head
Too much to be absorbed
You're into the top shackle
Mental saw-down of your head [1]
Which bemoans a simple fact.
You haven't found it yet.

It seemed so clear in bed
It's dark but your legs, they are dead
Your pen is encombed in mattress
You're not going to get it yet
You haven't found it yet

You're dying but still warm
Put this writing on your tomb
Spit out with dying breath
You haven't found it yet.

I dictate
Transcribe
Relations
Dear Cousin
It's destiny.

The grist that curtails the mill
shall make us strong

THE MIXER 

The Mixer is close to me
He turns his head and smiles at me. 
And I am blessed
Beyond my salary

The mixer
In Espanol restaurants
The people and staff they clap
The mixer sweats 
In comic type letters the voices are saying 
Clap, clap 
The mixer 
sweats 
The mixer sweats

The mixer of Jamaican origin
Born, raised in the US [1]
observes the Victorian [press/prayer]
Clap, clap, clap 
Clap, clap

The DLVDS is over-easy on the compress
And the mixer sweats.

[First eqipment line]
[Second equipment line]

The mixer is close to me
He turns his head and smiles at me [2]

[spoken] 'It possessed the sort of bright sound microphone with audio pickup pattern.
It can produce broad responses, hi-fidelity quality, no feedback and no
howling etc. We can express good sound of your voice, an excellent
melody orchestra, a self-contained filter control, explosive breath
sounds, controlled explosive breath sounds ...... wind noises, in
different locations....'

WHITE LIGHTNING 

In North Carolina way back in the hills
Lived my pappy and he had him a still
He brewed white lightning 'til the sun go down
Then he'd get out a jug and pass it around

Mighty mighty pleasin' 
Poppa kept a-squeezin' and called it
White Lightning

G-men, T-men, Revenue too
Searching for the place where he made his brew
They were lookin' tryna book him
But my pappy kept a-cookin' it
White Lightning

I asked my pappy why he called the brew
White Lightning's full of morning dew
Took one sip then I knew
When my eyes bulged out and my face turned blue

A city slicker came and he said "I'm mighty tough,
I wanna get a taste of the powerful stuff"
Took one slug and drank it right down
And I heard him moaning as he hit the ground

Shout!


A LOT OF WIND 

Desperate for entertainment
So I turn the TV on
There's people jumping up and down
Then they have the panel on
And they talk a lot of wind
They talk a lot of wind

Then they have the weatherman on
He used to teach all our friends
He talked a lot of wind
He talks a lot about wind

Then they have Carl Lewis on
He's got a ponytail and he's a vegan
He talks a lot of wind
He talks a lot about wind

I turn the tragic lantern on
It's a program 'Good Morning' [1]
It's a lot of wind
They talk a lot about wind

I'm real sick and in distress
I got octagonals in my eyelids
From watching all that wind
I get horrible horrible horrible dreams
So I ring the TV line and get a lot of wind
They talk a lot of wind

You see them selling carpets
You see them in the shops
You see them on the kids programs
And they talk a lot of wind

Oh the boredom in my bones
From belching a lot of wind
They talk a lot about wind
They talk a lot about wind

I gotta forget about the wind
Has a lot of nerve
To talk a lot about wind

There's a roly-poly, roly-poly man
He's got a yak haircut (dick, dick, dick)
They talk a lot about wind

ROSE 

The scarecrow's down
I hope you are alright
I am alright

There's a letter marked 'urgent'
I have not yet read it
Rose
Rose

I hear you are in Hampstead
I hope you can get married
Rose
Rose

Hear that wah-wah going?
Remember you started it
Freckles
Rose

It is now all the rage
With the younger set
Your replacement
He is a good man Rose?
Rose

I've got a good woman
Sometimes

RETURN 

God bless the cold winds and its refreshing consequence, uh-huh, 
Oh please return.

Hellas did tremble
Hellas did go away
Finding it difficult
To stand in its fury
Over the ironing board
But still this golden curl
Vented its Hellas fury

Return, baby baby baby come back to me.
Come back to me, return.

I was told to go easy and this one did
But still this golden creature raised its fury
Head sparkles

Return
Baby baby baby come back to me
Return

Is that a hair extension?
It's soaked in hair lotion
How can you smell your own head?
Return

Baby baby baby come back to me

I'll change the latch on the door
I'll get locks all over
I ran on up ahead
Sparkle and pander her


TIME ENOUGH AT LAST 

It's time I started thinking on my feet
Instead of on my back
Now I got time
Time enough at last

Time enough at last boy
Time enough at last
It's been the bane of my life
But I've got time enough at last
I got time
Time enough at last
Time enough at last boy
Time enough at last

And sometimes people think you're just stupid
But I got time enough at last
I got time
Time enough at last
Time enough at last boy
Time enough at last
Time enough at last boy
Time enough at last

Cos I got time
Time enough at last
It's just stupid thinkin' 'bout the past
Cos I got time enough at last
In a city in turmoil
It's hard to extract
The brains from the head of a minor executive
Now I got time
Time enough at last
Time enough at last boy
Time enough at last
Time enough at last boy
Time enough at last
And the projectiles hit you
When you least expect it

But I got time
Time enough at last
From a summit of experience
To a pit of its knowledge
Cos I got time
Time enough at last
Time enough at last boy
Time enough at last
I got time
Time enough at last


EVERYTHING HURTZ 

Come to me
Come unto me
All ye that labor
You that are heavy laden
Cos everything hurts

And everything hurts

I've been pursuing the fuel too long
Got a big fat pain in my chest bone
Got an on-empty pocketbook
Got a big fat no no in my chequebook
And everything hurts
And everything hurts
I got the disease tinnitus
I'm speakin' like I've got Tourrette's
And everything hurts X3
I'm born X 2

I'm dressed like a road beacon
On my way to Valhalla breakfast
And everything hurts
Can't you see the bitches by my side
Followin' me through all my life
And everything hurts
I was born X 3
Come to me all ye that labor and are heavy laden
My head dip dip dip dipping, man
All my limbs are disconnected
And everything hurts X3

I've been pursuing the fuel too long
Got a big fat pain in my chest bone
And everything hurts X2
Everything hurts
[...] man
Cos everything hurts
I got a big fat foot on my knee bone
And the back of my [?] is in my septum
And everything hurts X2

From immortality

JUST WAITING 

Pensioner's waiting for leap year to come
and the young singer's waiting to sing
and there's a gardener outside a big estate
waiting for the grass to turn green

The drunk is waiting for an easy mark
the hitchhiker is waiting for a ride
and the prisoner's waiting for a prison break
and the surfer is waiting for the tide

Ah just waiting

You know everything comes to a standstill
nothing seems to make a turn
cause the worm's still waitin' for the early bird
and the early bird's waitin' for the worm

And nobody wants to do nothing
just waiting for a finger in the pie
and waitin' for a call from a TV show
or waitin' for an uncle to die 1-2-3

Everybody's waitin' for something
and nothing ever turns out right
because the night shift is waiting for the morning
and the burglar is waiting for the night.

Congregation is waitin' for the vicar
and the vicar is waitin' for the groom
the groom is waiting for his new bride
But the bride is waitin' for June

And everybody is just waitin'
and nobody wants to settle down
They got their heads in a holo-video

The cretin is waitin for U2 to come on MTV again
but the producer is waiting for the blonde bird
and the blonde girl's waitin' for him

Nobody wants to do nothing
just waiting for their chips and their pie
waitin' for a call from a big quiz show
or waitin' for some rich relation to die

You know everything comes to a standstill
nothing ever makes a turn
and the worm is waitin' for the grass to turn green
while the early bird is waitin' for the worm

I don't think I can really stand it no more
I don't think I can go through it again
I'm just waiting
I'm just waiting
I'm just waiting
I'm just waiting

Yeah bees are waitin' for honey
and I'm putting it on the back burner for now
cause everybody's racing and fawning and skivin'
and honey I'm waitin' for you
Ah-just waitin'
Ah-just waitin'
Ah-just waitin'
Ah-just waitin'


SO CALLED DANGEROUS 

The selfish smiling fool and the sullen frowning fool shall both be thought wise

Think.
Like mountain climbing
or skiing in the alps
Think of it.
I don't.

It was a big fat February
Wet, the ugly pavement cracked
Pause, unsafe.

I thought:
Insect posse will be crushed.
It was a bit of Code Selfish.

There was not much going on
in the minds of the weak.
They were unprepared to be torched
By lighter kleptomaniacs,
So-called dangerous.

There is mad
And there is bad
And there is sad
And there is bad and sad.

Dangerous.

And the meek shall inherit the mirth.

They were big, panoramic
"Same again, sir?"
How can you have the same again?

Dangerous.


GENTLEMEN'S AGREEMENT 

We plough the fields together
In all types of intemperance
Our bones cracked in unison
Gentlemen's, gentlemen's agreement

You know what he is
And probably still is
Sticking his colours
To whatever new mast there is
But our agreement is over

I thought we had some kind of agreement
But with you it was just prurience
You're addicted to excitement
My energies are down now with yours
And you're sitting on my back fence
But I thought we had an agreement
Gentlemen's, gentlemen's agreement

Your brain is software
Your brain is Game Boy
It's filled with excretement
And your short-term memory
Will fleetingly remember
Our gentlemen's, gentlemen's agreement

Gentlemen's, gentlemen's agreement
Gentlemen's, gentlemen's agreement


MARRIED, 2 KIDS 

In 1978
Was in a hotel in Notting Hill Gate
Now in 1992
Staying in a hotel in Notting Hill Gate

Abject

I'm too busy to think
Too busy to work
Just can't cut it

Married, 2 kids
Married, 2 kids

I pretend to go to work
I pretend to go to work
Got a porta-fax
Aftershave like mustard
Two pints of lager do me in
And The Spirit of Man
Is a pub I go in
I'm married, 2 kids
Have a peculiar goatish smell
Am a long-winded article
I get livid
Married, 2 kids
Married, 2 kids


CREW FILTH 

From the valleys of Leicestershire
And all over
Came mystic crew filth
The first was Dave Bush-babe
The second was Graham pony-tail
They were mystic crew filth
Crew filth

[mock Urdu or Punjabi]

Then from the land of the accordion
Came Dave Kiwi
He was crew filth
He had the shirts
He wouldn't meditate
on his monitor room
Mystic
Crew filth

Hey mystic crew filth
Crew filth X4
Where did they come from?
The little motherfuckers
Nobody knows
Nobody bothers
Crew filth
Crew filth

Crew filth

One was a Kiwi
One was a Bush-baby
One had tattoos on his legs
One had brown spectacles on his head
Motherfuckers
Crew filth

Crew filth

Hey Kenny, tell us about crew filth

Crew filth X3

But those crew filth
They had sensitive sides to their nature
They would smoke pot in their rooms
They were always behind you
That's why we kept our backs to the walls
You gotta watch your wallet, man
Crew filth

What about crew filth Bill?
Bill was King of the fucking Motherfucker crew filth
He had to do some work one night
Then his hair turned white
Crew filth baby X3

Crew filth motherfucker

He was the worst, one of the worst X3
Gotta watch your friends
Watch your girl
You never can tell
He might kill a tab
While you're jumping off
All your friends might turn out to be
Crew filth

LADYBIRD (GREEN GRASS) 

And there's a big concert going down in this town
People cannot see society had broken down
I sat upon the green grass but it just brought me down
And the wife said 'get up' and it just brought me round

Fly ladybird, get right outta town
Use your transparent wings
Ladybird fly, fly ladybird

Green grass was purple black and speckled all around
Round the ring, this Croat town
The gas was obnoxious
It made me settle down, so I sat down
And the guy said 'get up' and it just brought me down

Fly ladybird, ladybird flee
Get right outta town, use your transparent wings
Above the leaping flames, get right outta here
Flee ladybird, ladybird fly

Pomerania is burning down.
Your family is gone, shot dead
Get right out of it
See the epaulette
Death: to let

Small change attached
I thought it was there but it just brought me down
Ripped the magazine open, it brought me round
Green grass was clear in the boundary zone
Grass faded into Wimpy brick in the ground

Mother's somewhere in Pomerania, but Pomerania is burning down
Ein kleine meisterwork, settled in my bones
Fly! Fly ladybird
Get right off the ground
Use your transparent wings
Get right outta here.


LOST IN MUSIC 

Le money il sur le table
Il money il sur la table
The palace of excess leads to the palace of access
Hideaway!

I'm lost in music
Feel so alive
Hideaway
sur la table

I'm lost in music
Caught in a trap
No looking back
Le money il sur la tableau
Brick house refurbishment of pubs in the hideaway.....

I'm lost in music
Caught in a trap
And there's no looking back
I'm lost in music
I'm lost in music
Feel so alive
I quit my ten-to-five
I'm lost in music

I'm lost in music
Lost in music
Hideaway
Snag table top, snag
Dip dip refurbishment of pubs
In the hideaway
And then I heard a voice say
You're lost in music
No turning back
Caught in a trap
You're lost in music
I'm lost in music
Caught in a trap
And there's no looking back
I'm lost in music

L'argent est sur la table, (the money is on the table)
Pris au piege, (trapped)
Inutile de regarder en arriere, (It's useless to look behind you)
Perdu dans la musique, (lost in music)
Cretin, va te faire foutre! (Asshole, fuck you!)

I'm lost in music
Feel so alive
I quit my ten-to-five

GLAM RACKET 

Stop eating all that chocolate
Eat salad instead
In fact, you're a half-wit from somewhere or other
Why don't you bog off back to Xanadu in Ireland

Glam Rick

Don't try to cheat me
I'm fragile
You hang around with camera crews in shell-suits
You lecture on sweets
You read Viz comic

Glam Rick

You are bequeathed in suede
You are entrenched in suede

You've got celluloid in your genes dad
You are Glam Rick
You've cut my income by one third
You are working on a video project
You hog the bathroom
And never put your hand in your pocket

You're paging the [Malagna] in Spain
But can't read between the lines
Your price, cut down is amazing
You're one of the best songs I've ever heard by Stephen King

Your Clearasil produces Richthofen rashes,
Sideboard-like on mountains
Clearasil is in conjunction

On the end of forests 
All the above will come back to you
And confirm you as a damn pest

I'M GOING TO SPAIN 

I've sold my car, thrown in my job, I'm 34 years old
I think it's time I saw the world, and not Australia
I've sold my car thrown in my job I'm 34 years old

I'm going to Spain
Cousin Norman had a real fine time last year
He said it doesn't rain
I hope I can quickly learn the language yeah
I hope I can quickly learn the language

And the factory floor presented me with some tapes of Elton John
I hope it might keep me company but I hate the goo- goo-goo-goodbyes
Coz I'm going to Spain
Cousin Norman had a real fine time last year
I hear it doesn't rain
I hope I can quickly learn the language yeah

IT'S A CURSE 

It's a curse
Well thy forsooth
Who is that interesting hack over there?
By Gad, verily
Cracked curse
disliked
burdened
It's a curse
And am not unguilty of using it

"You, your tone is....
You tone of everybody"

Trying to bolt out of 
Trying to get over
Operation mind fuck

"I do not like your tone.
It has ephemeral whinging [1] aspects."

It's a curse. I am not unguilty of using it.

Waiting for you to f....
Trying to get out of
Tryna get out of
Waiting
They are waiting for you, bitterly, for you to fall over.
It's a curse.

Down their long egg breath
Cheap shaving lotion days
Their sandwiches stashed under their side seats
Their froglike chins ready to burst
I tell you, it's a curse, it's a burden
Trying to get over bargain vampires
In shops
I tell you it's a curse

"You, you tone is...."
Trying to get out of
It's a curse
Shafted over 
It's a curse
It's a burden
That's burden
Operation Mind-Fuck

Look back bores
Bach and Wagner
All you really need is a good Schwartz
It's a curse
Balti and Vimto and Spangles [2] were always crap,
regardless of the look back bores.

It's a curse.
Shafted over.
Trying to bolt out of.
Waiting for you.
It's a curse.

[2] Balti = a type of Indian cuisine; Vimto = a fruit-flavoured concentrated beverage; Spangles = a brand of English candy


PARANOIA MAN IN CHEAP SH*T ROOM 

Paranoid man
In mid 30s
at the height of paranoia
at the zenith of his powers
By bed, replica shooter
zenith dissolving
by his bed replica shooter
in the zenith of his powers

When girls pass, puts his head down, in the street
His neighbors now are listening to this
Shakes in the chemist's
While buying his vits
Puts his head down
when girls pass in the street
Shakes in the chemist
Paranoid man in his late 30s
32, 45
Reaches its summit
Male, mid 30s, white, paranoia

Goes down to the dance
Going down fast.

No heebies, creepies
or hallucinogenics
It's the height of paranoia
Male, white, mid-to-late 30s
Serial Number 54129
Going down to the dance
Going down fast
Leather jacket, baggy black pants
Very clever
Not as good as it was at 2:30
this afternoon
Nostalgia
Spangles
Late to mid 30s

Goes down to the dance
and drooped mental inertia
Mid 30s man in the grip of paranoia
Just like I told ya
Prefers karaoka.
Cheap shit half-dollar man
The sky calendar,
bar, home,
speculates.


SERVICE 

Why do you have a cloud in your eye?

Walked downstairs
Got my hat and my corny brown leather jacket
Streets were grey and clean for a change
Must have been the rain
Thought transference
And this man in digs with me would spit out 
two or three teeth a night on the floor

Winter is here, unlike yourself
Cold, pulled my shirt up
Service

Kicked the leaves
Learning about time,
Time of the vulperines
Time of the wolverines
They sit rotting, the leaves
Kick the brown branches, it is here
I came home and found I could say the word "entrepreneur"
and my problem began
Service

(Every man wants to be what he is not.)

At my feet, one who laughs at anything.
And at my head, one that laughs at nothing
And I'm just in-between 
This day's portion
Service
(You would not like it if you knew it)

(Why you have tears in your eyes from infotainment?)

Winter is here
I've got a witch on my left shoulder
My future's here
Now I will kick the broken branches
They're this day's portion of this day's portion

Didn't want to wake up and learn, 
I've learnt the word 'entrepreneur"
Wandered around, found out,
Didn't want to say the word, roll it around in your mouth

Every man jack wants to be what he is not.
Service.

Little boys are taking over
They mumble through the grass
There are not fit to be in the company of vulperines and wolverines
Too many heads knocking about.
Service.
This day's portion, this day's portion.

Why do you have a cloud in your eye from infotainment?


THE LEAGUE OF BALD-HEADED MEN 

You know when you end up in some sort of a cine-complex
And the person next to you is someone you hate?
Well well well well well well well well with me,
I end up like that,
All around and inside left.

All through the walls
It suppurates.
Look it up!
I'm immobile.
Is your house for sale?

And Davey's just got out of his cell -
Where have you been this time?
Your lives are beyond the pale.
Walk the main drag, splayed.
See the blue baseball hatted, baseball blue hatted
School friends, pop mobs
Male loafers, business affairs advisers and members of the band.
Suppurates, look it up!

And every day it's my pleasure to meet
The great league of bald-headed men.

Your friends, pop mobs, first wives, ex-loafers

And every day it is my pleasure to meet
The league of bald-headed men.

Baseball hatted, blue capped.

[You scored passages to assuage their post-latent sexual baldy alopecia] [1]

And every day it's my pleasure to meet
The great league of bald-headed men.

Note: [1] this line is in the 'League Moon Monkey Mix' version only


A PAST GONE MAD 

Serial killers were always a bore in my book,
Along with Spangles and soccer books.
Rid us of old fogeys
Scuttling and swerving over the roads
Comma,
Kids in pubs.
Passable

Why is Pete Gabriel always following us?
And before the grub comes a moralist,
Dissonance of infotainment

A past gone mad!
Alive and well, he is on all channels
[Kiki Dee]
Dwelling in craven environment

If I ever end up like Ian McShane [1] slit my throat with a kitchen tool
And if I ever end up like U2 slit my throat with a garden vegetable

A past gone mad
Passable

Take a look back
Rear-view mirror: it's all behind you

A present gone mad
Tra-tra-la, follow, track that lava
Past, present gone mad.
Passable
A past gone mad.

Note: [1] English actor in TV series "Lovejoy"


LIGHT / FIREWORKS 

Cold, cold, you can't control
[computer voice: Light up a cigarette, cos it might be your last.]

Fireworks, darkness
Cascading with fireworks.
Fireworks, can't read it
Fireworks, can't fathom it
Fireworks.
Coming up to the dawn here
What are those burnt embers
It's fireworks, smouldering
It's fireworks, cascading in the sky
From 8 till 5 the morning,
Fireworks
Fear cracked, fear cracked
Splitting Chinese sky open,
Chinese sky at night
Exploding trees at night
Over rivers and bridges
Fireworks
Fireworks.
Fear craft.


WHY ARE PEOPLE GRUDGEFUL? 

All over the world... desolate
All over Europa... desolate

Come on, come on, come on...

When you were down and out
I always helped you out
And when you go out
You just chat and shop
You can walk and talk
Walk and talk
Without no fear at all
You can walk and talk
Walk and talk
Without no fear at all

(Why, why)
Why why are people grudgeful, boy?
Tell me why are people grudgeful, boy?

All over the world 
different different
All over Creation
Desolate, desolate
(why, why)

Coming coming coming they're coming, you are crumbling boy

Watch out watch out watch out
Why, why

Watch out
Why, boy, why
And you tend to forget
Coming, coming, coming right from you boy
And you tend to forget

All over the world 
Desolate, desolate
All over Europa
Desolate, desolate
(why, why)

So why, why are people grudgeful boy?
So why, why are people grudgeful boy?

Ah-watch out, watch out watch out, watch out...

RECKONING 

I phoned you up from Dallas
But your heart was still in marble
And your head
Was reckoning

Your friends are dis-compos-mentis
And like most in leather jackets are
Coveting
Reckoning
Reckoning

And you're sleeping with some hippie half-wit
Who thinks he's Mr. Mark Smith
Reckoning
Beckoning
Reckoning

I'm left alone in Europe
Consulting an atlas
Wandering
Wandering

And it's evil that you spark off
In disguise as basic truth
Listening
Listening
Listening
Reckoning
Reckoning

Reckoning


BEHIND THE COUNTER 

They're always hitting on me
But I'm getting thin
From waiting on
They just want me to be

Behind the counter

The hen centre
Was always picking on me
There they are tucking in all over shop
Got no time
For dinner or tea

Behind the counter
Every car I see
Is always picking on me
They take a left turn when I cross, guaranteed
They park on the pavement
Some have paid parks on the pavement
Here

I say "Wait sir, wait sir,
You'd better wait sir"
Guaranteed

I'm getting thin
From idiots who write rock books
Disparate
Ex-groups cold would've played this
"For Nose Pin and the Punk Piggies
Didn't quite make it," they say
Get behind the counter
The other side of the counter

Chill it, boy

The other side of the counter


M5 #1 

You'll never see me trying to raise Cain
You'll never see me wear a suit of green
There's a slip-road up right ahead
leading to the agragarian 
But I'm city born and bred
Too many car-fumes in my head
Just a well-read punk peasant.

But you'd think a country man would understand
the devil makes work for idle hands. 
M5 6-7 pm

And the man who pretends he knows it all
is destined to a Mighty Fall.
Gets into your house with cheer,
then proceeds to take all you've got to offer.
This is not an autobahn
It's an evil roundabout
That leads to the Haywain
And you'll never see good trains again.

In late 60s, my daddy said to me,
you'll never see trams and clogs again.
Now they roam the city.

Can these people not understand
The devil makes work for idle hands
M5 6-7 pm
The devil makes work for idle hands.

M5 to the country straight ahead
It's stuffed to the gills with crusty brown bread
Can they not understand 
there's nothing worse than a bored man?

M5, 6-7 PM


SURMOUNT ALL OBSTACLES 

You must retreat into mysticism
to find an origination.
Locate the base enclave,
Surmount all obstacles.

Heinz is guilty, 
He says "Look, I let the shot go by accident. I'm a black belt."
His face is full of ex ex ex ex-cruelty. Guilt. 
Blue-eyed. A caring sharing man. 
Embarrass them into extinction.

Must he retreat into mysticism,
Or locate the base and climb?
Surmount all obstacles.
Progress.

It must have taken [...]
Hours and hours, that
What an interesting article
Das Judy und das Judy
Are the cobwebs on your kitchen cuticles

Heinz is guilty
on the borders of your imagination.


MIDDLE CLASS REVOLT 

Everything you see you want.
Go to clubs. 
Middle class revolt.

Put it down....

He wants Homestyle
Sublimates the envy to C2s
Bump into each other and jolt
D2s, D1s, bump into each other and jolt
Middle class revolt

Calorific.
Middle class revolt
Everything you see
Middle class revolt
Go to clubs
Crashing into C2s
Middle class revolt

A man
Extremely lazy
Exhumes the cooked pigeon
His words indignant
Because it was cooked wrong
Middle class revolt


WAR 

Tell of the birth
Tell how war appeared on earth

Musicians with gongs
Permeate the autobahns
Foetus of disgusting breath

And she split the egg
Cast a spell and war was born

Come follow me
Out of the obscurity
Pilgrims in songs
Swamp the empty aerodrome
Kalashnikovs but no houses
Women at the double, march
No food for the spouses
They wait for the US drop
Russians sit back and laugh

While war casts her gory locks
Over the deserted docks
She casts her gory locks
Over the deserted docks

She cast a spell
Split an egg and war was born
And pillage hopes with gusto
Even though they have no nerve
And she does just look on
And war does what she has to

War does what she has to
People get what they deserve


YOU'RE NOT UP TO MUCH 

Not up to much
She's imitative
Her mind's in pieces
She said we can't all live
Her mind is in pieces
She said we can't all live in semi-detached houses

She's Oedipus
Not up to much
She gets the check
For car tax

She is Oedipus
She gets the check
For car tax
With barely a muttered
Thanks

Too much Warehouse shop 
Too many fancy hats
Clothes imitation
A body map

Her mind's in pieces
She said we can't all live in semi-detached houses
She's Oedipus
She gets the check
For car tax
With barely a muttered thanks
Too much Warehouse shop
Too many fancy hats
Clothes imitation
Body map

Her mind's in pieces
Her ballroom days are deceased

Love's boat is smashed
Against existence
She got set walking
Walking irritant
Not up to much
Not up to much
And love's boots
Smashed against existence
Got set to walking
Irritant
She's imitiative
She's not up to much
She's not up to much
She's not up to much
Not up to much
Not up to much
She's not up to much
HEY! STUDENT 

When I'm walking down the street,
It's always you I seem to meet,
Long hair down and sneakers on your feet.
And write your letters to the Evening News
I clench my fist and sing this tune:

I said Hey student, hey student, hey student,
You're gonna get it through the head,
I said Hey student, hey student, hey student,
You're gonna get it through the head, I said...

When walking to work,
It's always you I seem to meet
Henna in your hair, standing in the heat
As you serve us in [motor bows] a book kid
I clench my hand before I flip my lid.

CHORUS.

When walking down the street,
It's always you I seem to meet,
Long hair down and sneakers on your feet.
As you listen to Pearl Jam in your room.
I'm thinking like that when I sing this song:

CHORUS.

I said I woka-to-ma, woka-to-ma
Woka-to-ma, wah wah wah x2

When walking down the street,
It's always you I seem to meet,
Long hair down and sneakers on your feet.
As you stare in your room at Shaun Ryder's face
Down long long long long days

CHORUS.

I said I woka-to-ma, woka-to-ma
Woka-to-ma, wah wah wah x2

The dead brains of class A-D
Born to live in Leigh-on-Sea
Twin swastikas, court, swimming pool
I'm thinking like this when I sing this tune:

CHORUS.

I said I woka-to-ma, woka-to-ma
Woka-to-ma, wah wah wah x2


JUNK MAN 

Nah nah nah nah...

Tolerance is not a virtue

Junk man, lend a hand
Help me clear this track
Light a match, burn it up
Turn it into ash

Junk man, lend a hand
Help me clear this crap
Light a match, turn it up
Turn it into ash

Give me back the molasses you took from my sugar
Give me back the white of my bread
Give me back the alcohol you took out my bitter
I wanna see it in every pint

Junk man, lend a hand
Help me clear this stretch
Light a match, burn it up
Turn it into ash
Burn it into ash

Take back the molasses you took from my sugar
Take back the white from my bread
Take back the hung combs you took from my honey
I wanna see it in every [?]
You can't have it all
You can't have it all

Junk man, lend a hand
Help me clear this track
Light a match, burn it up
Turn it into ash
Turn it into ash

Dah dah dah dah...

And tolerance is not a virtue
For hog man's dirty groundhog

Junk man, lend a hand
Help me clear this strip
Give me back the Vitamin C you took from my orange
I wanna see it in every bowl
But you can't have it all
And you can't have it all

Junk man, lend a hand


THE $500 BOTTLE OF WINE 

-A 500 dollar bottle of wine [x2]
-A 500 dollar bottle of wine
-That's all we get for being with him all the time

I give them a 500 bottle of wine
That's all they get most of the time

-A 500 dollar bottle of wine [x2]

Two days in the desert
What did they get
For all of the tears and the grind
A 500 dollar bottle of wine

-We've been through desert
-And blew on our shirts (and Brix' torn our last shirts?) 
-And all the lightning and life
-We said so much to (just a) crazy and white (whine?)
-A half filled (no) bottle of wine

-A 500 dollar bottle of wine
-That's all I get man most of the time.

We been through the desert
Went through their last shirts
And all the lightning and crime
A half-filled bottle of wine.

-They're all fat gits and they get on our tits
-They're all fat gits and they get on our tits

That's all you get most of the time
For all the life in crime
The 500 bottle of wine

-Drive (been) through the desert (drive for) in 36 hours
-But when we get the ending we took
-The 500 dollar (bottle) of wine
-A 500 dollar bottle of wine

And I feel real guilty
The babies are squealing
Starving and pleading all the time
A 500 dollar bottle of wine

-A 500 dollar bottle of wine [x5]
-You think it's gonna get on my tits [x2]

They all bitch
They just whinge
And drink my last bottle of wine
I feel real guilty
I been through my last shirt
And I get guilty all the time

-Yeah
-C'mon
-500 dollars

Get down the fucking liquor store boy.


CITY DWELLER 

Dictum: vestige of the euro-bore
Random
It's a good life bowing to a tyrant

Gone
Christian gang chants sweet 
Regional 
Keep your head down for the moment

(That now suit is now in bucket
It's a good life, Europe)

Avoid the dismantled old heads stuck in bloody plant pots
All looking at them
Forgetting the endless drive against nature
City dweller

Must we base ourselves again into organic mud?
You're well welcome to it
Get out of my city you mediocre pseuds
And take those red-tie bastards
Who put up the olympic flag with you
They walk around leering at young girls in packs
Worse than any yobs

(.....Catalonian)

It's January 20th
Euro-bore I support media
Keep olympic bidding

City dweller
Backwards
More than you can ever know
Mr cab driver
What do you want
Mr cab driver

City dweller

This hillbilly cab driver
He has submerged himself into the pyche of the average 
Cab driver
They love me, they knock off 10 to 15 pence
This is wandering
Those casual days are over and dull
dull

Agricultural gangs chant for sweet freedom

Get out of my city 
You mediocre pseud 
And take those red tight bastards with you
City dweller

They should remember there's nothing worse 
Than a half-educated grim red dwarf 
City dweller
Cuts up
Cab driver, cab driver 
Oh Mr cab driver

(He's up there now, listening to us, I know he is)

Why do you leave a a poxy card?
Oh Mr cab driver

What do about it?

Too much to drink
Too many dugs
Too much sex
Too young
