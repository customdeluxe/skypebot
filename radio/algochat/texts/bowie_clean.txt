#The Lyrics of David Bowie
It's just a one dollar secret
A lover's secrets in the UK
Torn apart in the UK
In the dribble of May-Day
'87 and Cry
'87 and Cry
And there's nothing inside
And there's nothing in mind
And only you
Rocket on thru the sky
It couldn't be done without dogs
It couldn't be once without us
'87 and Cry
'87 and Cry

When the days were the days were the days boys
When blue ties were for the biggy guys
Frannie dressing down for the enemy
You saw him hangin' on the enemy
And there's no one in love
And there's nowhere to scream
And only you
Race on to wonder where
It couldn't be done without dogs
It couldn't be once without us
'87 and Cry
'87 and Cry
You can't make love with money
You can't make mistakes with babies
Nothing looked good on you
That's how I liked you best
Now you're ready for the real McCoy

Deep in the heart of Cupid
Murders on the heels of love
Just the ghost of a story
Just a one dollar secret
   Baby these were the sounds
   Baby these were the sounds
And only you
Whisper these things aren't true
It couldn't be done with dogs
It couldn't be once without us
'87 and Cry
'87 and Cry

1984



Someday they won't let you, so now you must agree
The times they are a-telling, and the changing isn't free
You've read it in the tea leaves, and the tracks are on TV
Beware the savage jaw
Of 1984

They'll split your pretty cranium, and fill it full of air
And tell that you're eighty, but brother, you won't care
You'll be shooting up on anything, tomorrow's never there
Beware the savage jaw
Of 1984


  Come see, come see, remember me?
  We played out an all night movie role
  You said it would last, but I guess we enrolled
  In 1984 (who could ask for more)
  1984 (who could ask for mor-or-or-or-ore)
  (Mor-or-or-or-ore)

I'm looking for a vehicle, I'm looking for a ride
I'm looking for a party, I'm looking for a side
I'm looking for the treason that I knew in '65
Beware the savage jaw
Of 1984

1984/Dodo



Someday they won't let you, but now you must agree
The times they are a-telling, and the changing isn't free
You've read it in the tea leaves, the tracks are on TV
Beware the savage jaw
Of 1984

They'll break your pretty cranium, and fill it full of air
And tell you that you're eighty, but lover you won't care
You'll be shooting up as usual like tomorrow wasn't there
Beware the savage jaw
Of 1984

Come see, come see, remember me?
We played at an all night movie role
You said it would last, but I guess we rolled
In 1984 (who could ask for more)
1984 (who could ask for more)

Now we can talk in confidence
Did you guess that we've been done wrong?
Lies jump in queue to be first in line
Such a shameless design

He thinks he's well screened from the man at the top
It's a shame that his children disagree
They coolly decide to sell him down the line
Daddy's brainwashing time

He's a dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me (didn't hear it from me)
He's a dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me (didn't hear it from me)

She's doesn't recall her blessed childhood of yore
When a unit was a figure, not a she
When lovers chose each other seems the perks are due
Another memo to screw

She's a dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me (didn't hear it from me)
She's a dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me (didn't hear it from me)

Can you wipe your nose my child
Without them slotting in your file a photograph?
Will you sleep in fear tonight?
Wake to find the scorching light of neighbour Jim
He's come to turn you in

Another dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me (didn't hear it from me)
Another dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me (didn't hear it from me)
Another dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me (didn't hear it from me)

Come see, come see, remember me?
We played at an all night movie role
You said it would last, but I guess we enrolled
In 1984, who could ask for more
1984, who could ask for mor-or-or-or-ore
Mor-or-or-or-ore

1984
1984 (who could ask for more)
1984
1984 (who could ask for more)
1984
1984 (who could ask for more)
1984
Ooooo

A Big Hurt



??Vemy-shi??

To meet her once just to know it through and through
I know, I know
But it ain't finished till the fat lady sings
I know, I know

How can I help you?
You're just a wanna-be
I'm a believer
You're a sex receiver
And me with a big hurt
You know I had a big hurt
From the very start
I'm hurting so bad
'Cause you're my roommate from hell


  Got to take some blows on the stepping stones
  Speak in extremes
  It'll save you time
  You were a saint abroad
  But a devil at home
  Come on here, woo-woo
  And kiss it for me

To meet her once just to know it through and through
I know, I know
Even a glass eye in a duck's ass can see that
I know, I know

How can I help you?
I'm hit with a big hurt
You know I had
A great big hurt
From the very start
I'm hurting so bad
And here come the indians oooo



Kiss it for me, woo-woo
Kiss it for me
Woo-woo, kiss it for me
Come on here, woo-woo
Kiss it for me
Kiss it where it counts
Kiss it for me
Come on here, woo-woo
Woo-woo, woo-woo, woo-woo, woo-woo
Kiss it for me

I know

A New Career In A New Town


No lyrics for A New Career In A New Town

A Small Plot Of Land



VERSE
  Poor soul
  Spit upon that
  Poor soul
  He never knew what hit him
  And it hit him so

  Poor dunce
  He pushed back the pigmen
  The Barbs laughed
  The fool is dead

Poor dunce
He's less than within us
The brains talk
But the will to live is dead
And prayer can't travel so far these days
The talk of your life
Standing so near
To innocent eyes
Poor dunce

Swings thru the tunnels
And claws his way
Is small life so manic
Are these really the days

Poor dunce
Poor dunce

VERSE

Poor soul
Poor soul
Poor soul

Absolute Beginners



I've nothing much to offer
There's nothing much to take
I'm an absolute beginner
And I'm absolutely sane
As long as we're together
The rest can go to hell
I absolutely love you
But we're absolute beginners
With eyes completely open
But nervous all the same


  If our love song
  Could fly over mountains
  Could laugh at the ocean/sail over heartaches second time
  Just like the films
  There's no reason
  To feel all the hard times
  To lay down the hard lines
  It's absolutely true

Nothing much could happen
Nothing we can't shake
Oh we're absolute beginners
With nothing much at stake
As long as you're still smiling
There's nothing more I need
I absolutely love you
But we're absolute beginners
But if my love is your love
We're certain to succeed



Across The Universe



Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away
Across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me

 1 (twice)
  Nothing's gonna change my world
  Nothing's gonna change my world

Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on
Across the universe
Thoughts meander like the restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way
Across the universe

 1 (twice)

Sounds of laughter, shades of life are ringing through my open ears
Inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love, which shines around me like a million suns
It calls me on and on and on
Across the universe

 1 (thrice)

 2 (twice)
  Nothing
  Nothing
  Nothing
  Nothing's gonna
  Nothing's gonna to change my world

 3
  Nothing's gonna change it
  Nothing's gonna change it

Hey

 3 (twice)

Nothing's gonna change my world

 3

Nothing's gonna change my world


African Night Flight



African nightmare one-time Mormon
More men fall in Hullabaloo men
I slide to the nearest bar
Undermine chairman I went too far
Bent on a windfall rent a sony
Wonder how the dollar went down
Gotta get a word to Elizabeth's father
Hey no, he wished me well

 1 (two times)
  Seemed like another day
  I could fly into the eye of god on high

 2 (two times)
  His burning eye will see me through
  One of these days, one of these days
  Gotta get a word through one of these days

 3 (two times)
  Asanti habari habari habari
  Asanti nabana nabana nabana

Getting in mood for a Mombassa night flight
Pushing my luck, gonna fly like a mad thing
Bare strip takeoff skimming over Rhino
Born in slumber less than peace
Struggle with a child whose screaming dreaming
Drowned by the props all steely sunshine
Sick of you, sick of me
Lust for the free life
Quashed and maimed
Like a valuable loved one
Left unnamed



Over the bushland over the trees
Wise like Orangutan that was me

After All




Please trip them gently, they don't like to fall, Oh by jingo
There's no room for anger, we're all very small, Oh by jingo
We're painting our faces and dressing in thoughts from the skies, from paradise
But they think that we're holding a secretive ball.
Won't someone invite them
They're just taller children, that's all, after all

Man is an obstacle, sad as the clown, Oh by jingo
So hold on to nothing, and he won't let you down, Oh by jingo
Some people are marching together and some on their own
Quite alone
Others are running, the smaller ones crawl
But some sit in silence, they're just older children
That's all, after all

I sing with impertinence, shading impermanent chords,
With my words
I've borrowed your time and I'm sorry I called
But the thought just occurred that we're nobody's children at all, after all

Live your rebirth and do what you will, Oh by jingo
Forget all I've said, please bear me no ill, Oh by jingo
After all, after all

After Today



Always in trouble
Never to blame
Must be your double
Feel the same
Here it comes again

Doing the wrong thing
Forgetting your lines
Waiting for something
Better to shine
Hate that same old game

After today - fortune then will find you
After today - plane will fly you away
After today - you'll find the one you're after
After today - look out, after today

What kind of rescue?
What will you be?
Where can you take it baby for free?
Break that heart for me!


  After today - the fortune fan will find you
  After today - they may pry you away
  After today - you'll find the one you're after
  After today - look out, after today



Today
After today
After toda-ay, hey
Look out, after today
Ah, yeah
Look, ah (laughter)
(spoken : I was getting in ta that)
(laughter)

Aladdin Sane



Watching him dash away, swinging an old bouquet - dead roses
Sake and strange divine Uh-h-h-uh-h-uh you'll make it
Passionate bright young things, takes him away to war - don't fake it
Sadden glissando strings
Uh-h-h-uh-h-uh - you'll make it

Who'll love Aladdin Sane
Battle cries and champagne just in time for sunrise
Who'll love Aladdin Sane

Motor sensational, Paris or maybe hell - I'm waiting
Clutches of sad remains
Waits for Aladdin Sane - you'll make it

Who'll love Aladdin Sane
Millions weep a fountain, just in case of sunrise
Who'll love Aladdin Sane

We'll love Aladdin Sane
Love Aladdin Sane

Who'll love Aladdin Sane
Millions weep a fountain, just in case of sunrise
Who'll love Aladdin Sane

We'll love Aladdin Sane
We'll love Aladdin Sane

Algeria Touchshriek



My name is Mr. Touchshriek
Of Touchshriek with mail over and fantasy
My shop sells egg shells off the shesores and empty females

I'm thinking of leasing the room above my shop
To a Mr. Walloff Domburg
A reject from the world wide Internet

He's a broken man
I'm also a broken man

It would be nice to have company
We could have great conversations
Looking through windows for demons
And watching the young advance in all electric

Some of the houses around here still have inhabitants in them
I'm not sure if they're from this country or not
I don't get to speak much to anyone or that sort of thing
If I had another broken name
Oh, I dream of something like that

All The Madmen




Day after day
They send my friends away
To mansions cold and grey
To the far side of town
Where the thin men stalk the streets
While the sane stay underground

Day after day
They tell me I can go
They tell me I can blow
To the far side of town
Where it's pointless to be high
'Cause it's such a long way down

So I tell them that
I can fly, I will scream, I will break my arm
I will do me harm
Here I stand, foot in hand, talking to my wall
I'm not quite right at all...am I?

Don't set me free, I'm as heavy as can be
Just my librium and me
And my E.S.T. makes three

'Cause I'd rather stay here
With all the madmen
Than perish with the sadmen roaming free
And I'd rather play here
With all the madmen
For I'm quite content they're all as sane
As me

(Where can the horizon lie
When a nation hides
Its organic minds
In a cellar...dark and grim
They must be very dim)

Day after day
They take some brain away
Then turn my face around
To the far side of town
And tell me that it's real
Then ask me how I feel

Here I stand, foot in hand, talking to my wall
I'm not quite right at all

Don't set me free, I'm as helpless as can be
My libido's split on me
Gimme some good 'ole lobotomy

'Cause I'd rather stay here
With all the madmen
Than perish with the sadmen
Roaming free
And I'd rather play here
With all the madmen
For I'm quite content
They're all as sane as me

All The Young Dudes



Billy rapped all night 'bout his suicide
How he'd kick it in the head when he was 25
Don't wanna stay alive when you're 25

Wendy's stealing clothes from unlocked cars
Freddy's got spots from ripping off stars from his face
Funky little boat race
The television man is crazy
Saying we're juvenile delinquent wrecks
Man I need a TV when I've got T. Rex
Hey brother you guessed
I'm a dude

 (twice)
  All the young dudes
  Carry the news
  Boogaloo dudes
  Carry the news

Now Jimmy looking sweet though he dresses like a queen
He can kick like a mule
It's a real mean team
We can love
Oh we can love
And my brother's back at home
With his Beatles and his Stones
We never got if off on that revolution stuff
What a drag
Too many snags
Well I drunk a lot of wine
And I'm feeling fine
Gonna race some cat to bed
Is this concrete all around
Or is it in my head
Oh brother you guessed
I'm a dude



Always Crashing In The Same Car



Every chance, every chance that I take
I take it on the road
Those kilometers and the red lights
I was always looking left and right
Oh, but I'm always crashing in the same car

Jasmine, I saw you peeping
As I pushed my foot down to the floor
I was going round and round the hotel garage
Must have been touching close to 94
Oh, but I'm always crashing in the same car

Amazing



I'm lazy
You're crazy, girl
Stay by my side

I'm scared you'll
Meet someone
In whom you'll confide


  Life's still a dream
  Your love's amazing
  Since I found you
  My life's amazing

I pledge you
You'll never be blue
There's too much at stake to be down

My nightmare
Rooted here watching you go
Divine in both, our lives



My life's a roll
Go go go
And it's amazing

Amlapura



Hey-hey it's the tall sail
On a beach reach for java
Make way for to Java
Watching for Boogies
Hey-hey it's a dreaming
I would burn you if you should die
Hey-hey I would burn too
If you should lie upon that bamboo pyre


  I dream of Amlapura
  Never saw in all my life a more shining jewel
  I dream of Amlapura
  Of an ocean or dream of a princess in stone

Hey-hey golden roses around
A rajah's mouth
Hey-hey all the dead children buried standing
A flying Dutchman
Smoking gun and spice wind



I dream of Amlapura
Of a princess in stone
Hey-hey it's a tall ship
Hey-hey
Hey-hey
Amlapura

Amsterdam



In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who sings
Of the dreams that he brings
From the wide open sea
In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who sleeps
While the river bank weeps
To the old willow tree

In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who dies
Full of beer, full of cries
In a drunken town fight
In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who's born
On a hot muggy morn
By the dawn's early light

In the port of Amsterdam
Where the sailors all meet
There's a sailor who eats
Only fish heads and tails
And he'll show you his teeth
That have rotted too soon
That can haul up the sails
That can swallow the moon

And he yells to the cook
With his arms open wide
"Hey, bring me more fish
Throw it down by my side"
And he wants so to belch
But he's too full to try
So he stands up and laughs
And he zips up his fly

In the port of Amsterdam
You can see sailors dance
Paunches bursting their pants
Grinding women to porch
They've forgotten the tune
That their whiskey voice croaked
Splitting the night
With the roar of their jokes
And they turn and they dance
And they laugh and they lust
Till the rancid sound of the accordion bursts
And then out of the night
With their pride in their pants
And the sluts that they tow
Underneath the street lamps

In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who drinks
And he drinks and he drinks
And he drinks once again
He'll drink to the health
Of the whores of Amsterdam
Who've given their bodies
To a thousand other men
Yeah, they've bargained their virtue
Their goodness all gone
For a few dirty coins
Well he just can't go on
Throws his nose to the sky
And he aims it up above
And he pisses like I cry
On the unfaithful love

In the port of Amsterdam
In the port of Amsterdam

An Occasional Dream



I recall how we lived
On the corner of a bed
And we'd speak of a Swedish room
Of hessian and wood
And we'd talk with our eyes
Of the sweetness in our lives
And tomorrows of rich surprise...
Some things we could do

In our madness
We burnt one hundred days
Time takes time to pass
And I still hold some ashes to me
An Occasional Dream

And we'd sleep, oh so close
But not really close our eyes
'Tween the sheets of summer bathed in blue...
Gently weeping nights
It was long, long ago
And I can't touch your name

For the days of fater were strong for you...
Danced you far from me

In my madness
I see your face in mine
I keep a photograph
It burns my wall with time
Time
An Occasional Dream
Of mine
An Occasional Dream
Of mine
An Occasional Dream
Of mine

And I Say To Myself



And I say to myself
I've got it wrong, wrong, wrong
She is a play-girl
She the wrong wrong girl for me
And I say to myself
You're a fool, fool, fool
She doesn't love you
She doesn't need you, this I know

She's got a trail of men that she takes
Wherever she goes
She hasn't the strength to love any single man for a length of time

[And I say to myself]
Ooh, I don't stand a chance
[And I say to myself]
It's a long long romance
[And I say to myself]
Well, she's out to slay
[And I say to myself]
Well, she's got it made
[And I say to myself]
Oh yeah, oh yeah
[And I say to myself]
Oh yeah

And I say to myself that she shouldn't love anybody else in the world but me
And I say to myself
Forget her now, now, now
She don't want you
She don't love you anymore
And I say to myself you're a fool, fool, fool
She's don't love you
She don't need you, this I know

And I turn around and look at myself
You'll never get her, you're a fool
Say after me I'm a fool- I'm a fool

[And I say to myself]
I can't get what I want
[And I say to myself]
And it makes me sad
[And I say to myself]
I can't get what I want
[And I say to myself]
And it makes me mad
[And I say to myself]
Oh yeah, oh yeah
[And I say to myself]
Oh yeah

And I say to myself that she shouldn't love anybody else in the world but me,
yeah
Yeah

[And I say to myself]
Oh, I feel so sad
[And I say to myself]
She's making me mad
[And I say to myself]
And I say to myself
[And I say to myself]
That I love her
[And I say to myself]
And I say to myself that I need her
[And I say to myself]
Oh, I need her

And I say to myself I'm a fool
And I say to myself

Andy Warhol



Like to take a cement fix
Be a standing cinema
Dress my friends up just for show
See them as they really are
Put a peephole in my brain
Two New Pence to have a go
I'd like to be a gallery
Put you all inside my show

Andy Warhol looks a scream
Hang him on my wall
Andy Warhol, Silver Screen
Can't tell them apart at all

Andy walking, Andy tired
Andy take a little snooze
Tie him up when he's fast asleep
Send him on a pleasant cruise
When he wakes up on the sea
Be sure to think of me and you
He'll think about paint and he'll think about glue
What a jolly boring thing to do

Andy Warhol looks a scream
Hang him on my wall
Andy Warhol, Silver Screen
Can't tell them apart at all (chorus x2)

Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere




  I can go anyway (way I choose)
  I can live anyhow (win or lose)
  I can go anywhere (for something new)
  Anyway, anyhow, anywhere I choose

I can do anything (right or wrong)
I can talk anyhow (and get along)
I don't care anyway (I never lose)
Anyway, anyhow, anywhere I choose

Nothing gets in my way
Not even locked doors
Don't follow the lines that been laid before
I get along anyway I care
Anyway, anyhow, anywhere



Anyway, anyway I choose
I wanna go
Do it myself, do it myself, do it myself, do it myself
Anyway, anyway I choose

As The World Falls Down



There's such a sad love
Deep in your eyes, a kind of pale jewel
Open and closed within your eyes
I'll place the sky within your eyes

There's such a fooled heart
Beating so fast in search of new dreams
A love that will last within your heart
I'll place the moon within your heart


  As the pain sweeps through
  Makes no sense for you
  Every thrill has gonst
  Wasn't too much fun at all
  But I'll be there for you-oo-oo
  As the world falls down

Falling
(As the world) Falling down
Falling in love

I'll paint you mornings of gold
I'll spin you Valentine evenings
Though we're strangers till now
We're choosing the path between the stars
I'll leave my love between the stars



Falling
(As the world) Falling down
Falling
As the world falls down
Falling
Falling
Falling
Falling in love
As the world falls down
(down) Falling
Falling
Falling
Falling in love
As the world falls down

Falling
Falling
Falling

Makes no sense at all
Makes no sense to fall
Falling
As the world falls down
Falling
Falling
Falling in love
As the world falls down
(down) Falling
Falling
Falling in love
Falling in love (love)
Falling in love
Falling in love
Falling in love

Ashes To Ashes



Do you remember a guy that's been
In such an early song
I've heard a rumour from Ground Control
Oh no, don't say it's true

They got a message from the Action Man
"I'm happy, hope you're happy too
I've loved all I've needed to love
Sordid details following"

The shrieking of nothing is killing
Just pictures of Jap girls in synthesis and I
Ain't got no money and I ain't got no hair
But I'm hoping to kick but the planet it's glowing


  Ashes to ashes, funk to funky
  We know Major Tom's a junkie
  Strung out in heaven's high
  Hitting an all-time low

Time and again I tell myself
I'll stay clean tonight
But the little green wheels are following me
Oh no, not again
I'm stuck with a valuable friend
"I'm happy, hope you're happy too"
One flash of light but no smoking pistol

I never done good things
I never done bad things
I never did anything out of the blue, woh-o-oh
Want an axe to break the ice
Wanna come down right now




  My mother said to get things done
  You'd better not mess with Major Tom

Baal's Hymn (Der Choral Vom Großen Baal)



Whilst his mother's womb contained the growing Baal
Even then the sky was waiting quiet and pale
Naked, young, immensely marvellous
Like Baal loved it, when he came to us

That same sky remained with him in joy and care
Even when Baal slept peaceful and unaware
At night a lilac sky, a drunken Baal
Turning pious as the sky grows pale

So through hospital, cathedral, whiskey bar
Baal kept moving onwards and just let things go
When Baal's tired, boys, Baal cannot fall far
He will have his sky down there below

When the sinners congregate in shame together
Baal lay naked, revelling in their distress
Only sky, a sky that will go on forever
Formed a blanket for his nakedness

And that lusty girl, the world, who'll laughing yield
To the men who'll stand the pressure of her thighs
Sometimes gave him love-bites, such as can't be healed
Baal survived it, he just used his eyes

And when Baal saw lots of corpses scattered round
He felt twice the thrill, despite the lack of room
"Space enough" said Baal, "then I'll thicken the ground
Space enough within this woman's womb"

Any vice for Baal has got its useful side
It's the man who practices it, he can't abide
Vices have their point, once you see it as such
Stick to two for one will be too much

Slackness, softness are the sort of things to shun
Nothing could be harder than the quest for fun
Lots of strength is needed and experience too
Swollen bellies can embarrass you

Under gloomy stars and this poor veil of tears
Baal will graze a pasture till it disappears
Once it's been digested to the forest's teeth
Baal trod singing for a well earned sleep

Baal can spot the vultures in the stormy sky
As they wait up there to see if Baal will die
Sometimes Baal pretends he's dead, but vultures swoop
Baal in silence dines on vulture-soup

When the dark womb drags him down to its prize
What's the world still mean to Baal, he's overfed
So much sky is lurking still behind his eyes
He'll just have enough sky when he's dead

Once the Earth's dark womb engulfed the rotting Baal
Even then the sky was up there, quiet and pale
Naked, young, immensely marvellous
Like Baal loved it when he lived with us

Baby



Baby
Don't you cry
Baby
I'll sing you a lullabye

We're walking down the
Street of chance
Where the chance is always
Slim or none
And the intentions unjust

Baby there's nothing to see
I've already been
Down the street of chance

Baby you're so clean
Baby please stay clean
Baby you're so young
Baby please stay young
Baby, don't you cry
Baby, we've already cried

Baby Can Dance



I'm rolling out of the ferris wheel
No one looks and no one feels
But the baby can the baby can

The way it feels just feeling you
Holding out and falling out
But the baby can the baby can


  I'm the jumping man
  I'm the jumping man
  But baby can float
  Baby can drown
  Baby can touch her toes
  Toss her hair
  Makes you feel you're going nowhere
  Baby can dance
  Baby can dance
  Baby can walk around the town
  Attract a man and cut him down

I'm the shadow man the jumping jack
The man who can and don't look back
But the baby can the baby can

I'm rolling out of the ferris wheel
No one looks and no one feels
But the baby can the baby can



And the way it feels
I'm feeling you

Everyday is far away
Everyday, everyday
It's over now
It's over now



Baby Grace (A Horrid Cassette)



Test, testing, testing
This, hmmm, Grace is my name
And and I was...um...
It was that phot... a fading photograph of
A patch, a patchwork quilt.
And they've put me on these
Ramona put me on these interest drugs
So I'm thinking very, too, bit too fast like a brain hatch
And ah they won't let me see anybody
If I want to sometimes and I ask
I can still hear some pop...popular musics
And aftershocks. (Ahhh-choo)
See I've been watching a television of um... in the homelands
That's the new homelands and um that's all I can remember
And now they just want me to be quiet
And I think something is going to be horrid

Baby It Can't Fall



You have loved me with energy
Backed up with hard work and guts
We inhabit eternity
We fly forever in space

The way we run together
The way we breeze the miles
We put our heads together
And laughingly we smile

It can't fall
It can't fall
Baby, it can't fall
Death means nothing at all

It can't fall
It can't fall
Baby, it can't fall
Our love will outlive this earth

Words have so many meanings
Sometimes mean nothing at all
Sometimes I feel so simple
I don't know what's coming next

We have swum in the ocean
And that was really alright
I'm not a big man
It's hard to face the world

It can't fall
It can't fall
Baby, it can't fall
Death means nothing at all

It can't fall
It can't fall
Baby, it can't fall
Our love will outlive this earth

It can't fall

Baby Loves That Way



[Baby loves that way]
Yes, she does, yes, she does
[Baby loves that way]
Oh, I love my baby
[Baby loves that way]
Ooh, I gotta take her
[Baby loves that way]
Yep, I love her

Baby likes to go outside, so I let her
Wants to fool with other guys, so I let her
Wants to be bad, so I let her be bad
But fooling around, it will make me sad
She fools around with other boys and treat me like an unwanted toy

[Baby loves that way]
Oh, I love my baby
[Baby loves that way]
Ooh, she does too much to me
[Baby loves that way]
And I can't think too much of her
[Baby loves that way]
Gotta take her, gotta take her

Gonna better leave her alone, put you down son
Treating her real fine, thus I'm home being a loner
Jeanny's my babe and that's alright, yeah
She treats me good, each and every night
She fools around with other boys and treat me like an unwanted toy

[Baby loves that way]
I love my baby
[Baby loves that way]
Ooh, she's too much
[Baby loves that way]
Yes she does, yes she does
[Baby loves that way]

[Baby loves that way]
I love my baby
[Baby loves that way]
Yeah, she's too much, yeah yeah
[Baby loves that way]
Ooh, I think she can live with me
[Baby loves that way]
Love her, love her, love her

Baby likes to go outside, so I let her
Wants to fool with other guys, so I let her
Wants to be bad, so I let her be bad
But fooling around, it will make me sad
She clings around with all the boys, who treat her like unwanted toys

[Baby loves that way]
Obviously this is the end
[Baby loves that way]
Gotta take her
[Baby loves that way]
Ooh yeah
[Baby loves that way]
Can't do enough
[Baby loves that way]

Ballad Of The Adventurers (Die Ballade Von Den Abenteurern)



Sickened by sun, with rainstorms lashing him rotten
A looted wreath crowning his tangled hair
Every moment of his youth apart from its dream was forgotten
Gone the roof overhead, but the sky was always there

Oh you, who are flung out, alike from heaven and from Hades
You murderers who've been so bitterly repaid
Why did you part from the mothers who nursed you as babies
It was peaceful and you slept and there you stayed

Still he explores and rakes the absinthe green oceans
Though his mother has given him up for lost
Grinning and cursing with a few odd tears of contrition
Always in search of that land where life seems best

Loafing through hells and flocked through paradises
Calm and grinning, with a vanishing face
At times he still dreams of a small field he recognises
With a blue sky overhead and nothing else

Bang Bang



Wow this ain't the right thing to do   so let's go

Young girls they know what they're after
Young girls don't kiss me goodbye
Rockets shooting up into space
Buildings they rise to the skies

Bang Bang I got mine
Bang Bang reach for the sky

I keep a good friend on videotape
He'll drive his sports car until it's too late
But we'll have a hot time on the town tonight
Cause love is my bet and it's the best yet

Bang Bang I got mine
Bang Bang sun don't shine
Bang Bang you all angels
Bang Bang now you all ought to be in pictures

Oh girl
Oh girl my problems can't follow me
Phone calls I take my machine
I wander lonely to the sea
Lonely-Ha Ha-what does it mean

Bang Bang I got mine
Bang Bang and you are next in line
Bang Bang reach for the sky
Bang Bang sun don't shine

Rise buildings
Rise to the sky
Young girls they know what they're after
I said, young girls don't kiss me goodbye

Bars Of The County Jail



La la la la la la la la (etc.)

Gather you all and listen here
I'll tell you a tale if you lend me an ear
I rode a horse through many a town
But the devil rode me down to the ground
I was to marry a very rich girl
I loved her as only I can
But the father was shot and his gold was stoled
And now I'm the devil's man, na na na
And now I sing a tail of woe
Through the bars of the county jail, na la la la la la la la la la

La la la la la la la la (etc.)

I walked into the room one night
I found her mother and gun
Well, the man was dead and I kneeled and cried
The sheriff ran in and said "I'm holding you, son"

La la la la la la la la (etc.)

Through the day I sing and play
For time is on my side
But when the moon and stars come out
I lay me down and cry
For the Saviour, mar I lied
Now I will not have a ride
Beside the window the scaffold was made
On the morrow I will hang...

La la la la la la la la (etc.)

Battle For Britain (The Letter)



My, my, the time do fly
When it's in another pair of hands
And a loser I will be
For I've never been a winner in my life

I got used to stressing pain
I used the sucker pills to pity for the self
Oh, it's the animal in me
But I'd rather be a beggarman on the shelf

Don't be so forlorn, it's just the payoff
It's the rain before the storm
On a better day, I'll take you by the hand
And I'll walk you through the doors

Don't be so forlorn, it's just the payoff
It's the rain before the storm
Don't you let my letter get you down
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you

My, my, but time do fly
When it's in another pair of pants
And illusion I will be
For I've never been a sinner, la di da

Don't be so forlorn, it's just the payoff
It's the rain before the storm
Don't you let my letter get you down
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you

Don't you let my letter get you down, down, down, down
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you
Don't you let my letter get you down, down, down, down
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you

Down, down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down

Be My Wife



VERSE
  Sometimes you get so lonely
  Sometimes you get nowhere
  I've lived all over the world
  I've left every place


  Please be mine
  Share my life
  Stay with me
  Be my wife

VERSE



Sometimes you get so lonely

Beat Of Your Drum



Photograph king, watches you go
Fashions may change, heaven knows, but you still leave a stain on me

Supplement queen, your colours may fade
Seasons may change, weather blows, but you still leave a mark on me

Wrong-negative fades-never the twain, reckless and tame

I like the beat of your drum
I like to look in your eyes
I like to look thru your things
I'd like to beat on your drum

I like the smell of your flesh
I like the dirt that you dish
I like the clothes that you wear
I'd like to beat on your drum

Disco brat-follow the pack
Watching you peel, heaven knows, prison can't hold all this greedy
   intention

Vanity's child-picture you now
Music may change-hi-di-ho keen to follow your nose

Wrong-love out of tune
Sweet is the night, bright light destroys me


  I like the beat of your drum
  I like to look in your eyes
  I like to look thru your things
  I'd like to beat on your drum

  I like the smell of your flesh
  I like the dirt that you dish
  I like the clothes that you wear
  I'd like to beat on your drum

  I'd like to beat on your drum
  I'd like to beat on your drum
  I like your face in the crowd
  I'd like to beat on your drum

  I'd like to beat on your drum
  I'd like to beat on your drum
  I'd like to blow on your horn
  I'd like to beat on your drum

Beauty And The Beast



Oooooooo...

Weaving down a byroad, singing the song
That's my kind of highrolling gone wrong
My-my
Smile at least
You can't say no to the Beauty and the Beast

Something in the night
Something in the day
Nothing is wrong but darling
Something's in the way
There's slaughter in the air
Protest on the wind
Someone else inside me
Someone could get skinned, how?
My-my
Someone fetch a priest
You can't say no to the Beauty and the Beast
Darling

My-my
You can't say no to the Beauty and the Beast
(Weakling)
My-my
You can't say no to the Beauty and the Beast

I wanted to believe me
I wanted to be good
I wanted no distractions
Like every good boy should

My-my

Nothing will corrupt us
Nothing will compete
Thank god heaven left us
Standing on our feet
My-my
Beauty and the Beast

My-my
Just Beauty and the Beast
You can't say no to the Beauty and the Beast
Darling

My-my
My
My-my

Because You're Young



Psychodelicate girl - come out to play
Little metal faced-boy - don't stay away
They're so war-torn and resigned she can't talk any more
What are they trying to prove?
What would they like to find?

It's love back to front and no sides - like I say
These pieces are broken - like I say
These pieces are broken
Hope I'm wrong but I know


  Because you're young - you'll meet a stranger some night
  Because you're young - what could be nicer for you and it makes me sad
  So I'll dance my life away
  A million dreams, a million scars

He punishes hard - was loving her such a crime
She took back everything she said
Left him nearly out of his mind
They're people I know - people I love
They seem so unhappy - dead or alive

It's love back to front and no sides - like I say
These pieces are broken - like I say
These pieces are broken
Hope I'm wrong but I know



A million dreams
A million scars
A million 

Betty Wrong



Till the sun blisters and sprays
And every lamb ceases to graze
When the kiss of the comb
Tears my face from the bone


  I'll be your light
  When the shadows fall down the walls
  Then life will be done
  And it just won't matter at all

I was caught from a hand
Nurtured on grime, goodwill and screams
Now your breath fills my step
Now there is you till life is gone



I'll roll your ball
Till the stars can't make me cry
Then life will be done
And it just won't matter at all
Not at all

When the kiss of the comb
Tears my face

Big Brother



Don't talk of dust and roses
Or should we powder our noses?
Don't live for last year's capers
Give me steel, give me steel, give me pulsars unreal

He'll build a glass asylum
With just a hint of mayhem
He'll build a better whirlpool
We'll be living from sin, then we can really begin

Please savior, saviour, show us
Hear me, I'm graphically yours


  Someone to claim us, someone to follow
  Someone to shame us, some brave Apollo
  Someone to fool us, someone like you

We want you Big Brother, Big Brother

I know you think you're awful square
But you made everyone and you've been every where
Lord, I'd take an overdose if you knew what's going down

 (3 times)

We want you Big Brother

Black Country Rock



Pack a pack horse and rest up here on
Black Country Rock
You never know, you might find it here on
Black Country Rock

Some say the view is crazy
But you may adopt another point of view
So if it's much too hazy
You can leave my friend and me with fond adieu

Black Tie White Noise



Getting my facts from a Benneton ad
I'm lookin' thru African eyes
Lit by the glare of an L.A. fire
I've got a face, not just my race, Bang Bang I've got you babe

Sun comes up and the man goes down
And the woman comes again
Just an hour or so to be safe from fear
Then we jump thru hoops, we're divisable now, just disappear

We reach out over race and hold each other's hands
Then die in the flames singing "we shall overcome"
Whoa! What's going on?
There'll be some blood no doubt about it
But we'll come thru don't doubt it
I look into your eyes and I know you won't kill me
You won't kill me
You won't kill me
But I look into your eyes
And I wonder sometimes

Oh Lord, just let him see me
Lord, Lord just let him hear me
Let him call me brother
Let him put his arms around me
Let him put his hands together.

Reach over race and hold each other's hands
Walk thru the nite thinking we are the world
Woa! What's going on?
There'll be some blood no doubt about it
But we'll come thru don't doubt it

I look into your eyes and I know you won't kill me
You won't kill me
You won't kill me
But I wonder why
Yes, and I wonder why sometimes

They'll show us how to break the rules
But never how to make the rules
Reduce us down to witless punks
Facist cries both black and white, who's got the blood, who's got the gun.

Putting on the black tie, cranking out the white noise

(Just a fool!)

Blackout



Oh you, you walk on past
Your lips cut a smile on your face
Your scalding face
To the cage, to the cage
She was a beauty in a cage

Too, too high a price
To drink rotting wine from your hands
Your fearful hands
Get me to a doctor's I've been told
Someone's back in town the chips are down
I just cut and blackout
I'm under Japanese influence
And my honour's at stake

The weather's grim, ice on the cages
Me, I'm Robin Hood and I puff on my cigarette
Panthers are steaming, stalking, screaming

If you don't stay tonight
I will take that plane tonight
I've nothing to lose, nothing to gain
I'll kiss you in the rain
Kiss you in the rain
Kiss you in the rain
In the rain
Get me to the doctor

Get me off the streets (get some protection)
Get me on my feet (get some direction)
Hot air gets me into a blackout
Oh, get me off the streets
Get some protection
Oh get me on my feet (wo-ooh!)

While the streets block off
Getting some skin exposure to the blackout (get some protection)
Get me on my feet (get some direction, wo-ooh!)
Oh get me on my feet
Get me off the streets (get some protection)
In a *? second *  ?  *

Blue Jean



Blue Jean-I just met me a girl named Blue Jean
Blue Jean-she got a camouflaged face and no money
Remember they always let you down when you need 'em
Oh, Blue Jean-is heaven any sweeter than Blue Jean
She got a police bike
She got a turned up nose

Sometimes I feel like
(Oh, the whole human race)
Jazzin' for Blue Jean
(Oh, and when my Blue Jean's blue)
Blue Jean can send me
(Oh, somebody send me)
Somebody send me
(Oh, somebody send me)

One day I'm gonna write a poem in a letter
One day I'm gonna get that faculty together
Remember that everybody has to wait in line
Blue Jean-look out world you know I've got mine
She got Latin roots
She got everything

Bombers



()
  All clear wail the sirens
  Sunshine on the wasteland
  Old man sitting in the white sand
  Think we're in for a big surprise
  Right between the eyes

Seemed a good idea
To drop a bomb on the wasteland here
Only one man could be seen
And he was old and so serene
Captain sat in his deck chair
And the red light flashed Beware
Pilot felt quite big-time
As the bomb sailed through the air
Well, they danced and sang
When the bang went bang
When the lights popped out
And the smoke began to clear
It was positively queer

()

"Die" said the General
"Cobblers" said the man
So the Pentagon sent a cable
And the Queen a telegram
A-bombs, H-bombs, even very small ones
Ripped apart that sand
'Til the stench was just revolting
And the sky a greenish tan
But the soldier said "Sir,
there's a crack in the world"
And the figures went "squash",
and the bits flew far and wide
How the universe sighed!

( twice)

When the smoke had blown away
There was nothing left to view
Except a man dear Lord who looked like you
Floating high up in the sky

Boys Keep Swinging



Heaven loves ya

Breaking Glass



Baby, I've been, breaking glass in your room again
Listen

Don't look at the carpet, I drew something awful on it
See

You're such a wonderful person
But you got problems oh-oh-oh-oh
I'll never touch you

Buddha Of Suburbia



Living in lies by the railway line
Pushing the hair from my eyes
Elvis is English and climbs the hills
Can't tell the bullshit from the lies
Screaming along in South London
Vicious but ready to learn
Sometimes I fear that the whole world is queer
Sometimes but always in vain


  So I'll wait until we're sane
  Wait until we're blessed and all the same
  Full of blood, loving life and all it's got to give
  Englishman going insane
  Down on my knees in suburbia
  Down on myself in every way

With great expectations I change all my clothes
Mustn't grumble at silver and gold
Screaming above Central London
Never bored, so I'll never get old



Day after
Day after
Day
Day after
Zane, Zane, Zane
Ouvre le chien
Day after

Day after
Zane, Zane, Zane
Ouvre le chien

Bus Stop



There's a cry that is heard in  the city
Froom Vivian at Pentecost Lane
A shriekin' and dancing till 4 a.m.
Another night of muscles and pain
I love you despite your convictions
That God never laughs at my jokes


  I'm a young man at oods with the Bible
  But I don't pretend faith never works
  When we're down on our knees
  Prayin' at the bus stop

Now Jesus he came in a vision
And offered you redemption from sin
I'm not sayin' that I don't believe you
But are you sure that it really was him
I've been told that it couldn've been blue cheese
Or the meal that we ate down the road
Hallelujah



Can You Hear Me



Once we were lovers, can they understand?
Closer than others I was your, I was your man
Don't talk of heartaches, ohh, I remember them all
When I'm checking you out one day, to see if I'm
Faking it all


  Can you hear me?
  Can you feel me inside?
  Show your love, love
  Take it in right (take it in right)
  Take it in right (take it in right)

There's been many others (Oo-oo-oo-oohh) so many times
Sixty new cities, an' what do I, what do I
What do I find?
I want love so badly, I want you most of all
You know, it's harder to take it from anyone
It's harder to fall
Can you hear me call ya?



Well, can you hear me? (yeah)
Can you feel me inside (I do)
Show your love, show your sweet, sweet love
Show me your love
Take it in right (take it in right)
Take it in right, yeah (take it in right)
Take it in right to your love life, baby

Take it in right To your love life
Take it in right, take it in right, right to your love life
Take it in right, ah
Take it in, take it in right

Right down, right down
  (Why don't you take it?)
Mmmm, why don't you take it?
  (Right to your heart)
Can you hear me?
  (Why don't you take it?)
Can you feel me?
  (Why don't you take it?)
Can you? Take it in right
  (Why don't you take it?)
Wuhh, right down, right down
  (Right to your heart)
Can you take it? Feel me?
  (Why don't you take it?)
Down, to right down
  (Why don't you take it?)
To your heart
  (Why don't you take it?)
To your heart
  (Right to your heart)
Take it down, take it down

  (Why don't you take it? Why don't you take it?)
Take it in right
  (Right to your heart)

Can't Help Thinking About Me



Question-time that says I brought dishonour
My head's bowed in shame
It seems that I've blackened the family name
Mother says that she can't stand the neighbours' talking
I've gotta pack my bags, leave this home, start walking, yeah
I'm guilty
I wish that I was sorry this time
I wish that I could pay for my crime

I can't help thinking about me

Remember when we used to go to church on Sundays
I lay awake at night, terrified of school on Mondays
Oh, but it's too late now
I wish I was a child again
I wish I felt secure again

I can't help thinking about me

As I pass a recreation ground
I remember my friends, always been found and I can't

I can't help thinking about me

Now I leave them all in the never-never land
The station seems so cold, the ticket's in my hand
My girl calls my name "Hi Dave
Drop in, see around, come back
If you're this way again"
Oh, I'm on my own
I've got a long way to go
I hope I make it on my own

I can't help thinking about me

Candidate



I'll make you a deal, like any other candidate
We'll pretend we're walking home 'cause your future's at stake
My set is amazing, it even smells like a street
There's a bar at the end where I can meet you and your friend
Someone scrawled on the wall "I smell the blood of les tricoteuses"
Who wrote up scandals in other bars

I'm having so much fun with the poisonous people
Spreading rumours and lies and stories they made up
Some make you sing and some make you scream
One makes you wish that you'd never been seen
But there's a shop on the corner that's selling papier mache
Making bullet-proof faces, Charlie Manson, Cassius Clay
If you want it, boys, get it here, thing

So you scream out of line
"I want you! I need you! Anyone out there? Any time?"
Tres butch little number whines "Hey dirty, I want you
When it's good, it's really good, and when it's bad I go to pieces"
If you want it, boys, get it here, thing

Well, on the street where you live I could not hold up my head
For I put all I have in another bed
On another floor, in the back of a car
In the cellar like a church with the door ajar
Well, I guess we've must be looking for a different kind
But we can't stop trying 'til we break up our minds
'Til the sun drips blood on the seedy young knights
Who press you on the ground while shaking in fright
I guess we could cruise down one more time
With you by my side, it should be fine
We'll buy some drugs and watch a band
Then jump in the river holding hands

Candidate (demo)



Inside every teenage girl there's a fountain
Inside every young pair of pants there's a mountain
Inside every mother's eyes is Tommy Tinkrem's bed
Inside every candidate waits a grateful dead

I make it a thing, when I'm on my own to relieve myself
I make it a thing, when I gazelle on stage to believe in myself
I make it a thing, to glance in window panes and look pleased with myself
Yeah, and pretend I'm walking home

I took it so bad, I sat in the correction room
Took me a fag, and a kick in the moon
Well, I ain't gonna suck no radar wing
Because inside this tin is tin
Would you like to techno-plate 'cause I'm your candidate, oh yeah

It's a matter of life
And the way you walk, you've got a BrylCream queen
It's a matter of tact
In the things you talk, that keeps his passport clean
A matter of fact
That a cock ain't a cock on a twelve inch screen
So I'll pretend I'm walking home

You don't have to scream a lot to keep an age in tune
You don't have to scream a lot to predict monsoons
You don't have to paint my contact black
Now I've hustled a pair of jeans
Do I have to give your money back when I'm the Fuhrerling?

I'll make you a deal
I'll say I came from from Earth and my tongue is taped
I'll make you a deal
You can get your kicks on the candidate
I'll make you a deal
For your future's sake, I'm the candidate
Lets pretend we're walking home

uh-huh, uhhh
I'm the candidate
Make way for the candidate
Vote now for the candidate

Cat People



See these eyes so green
I can stare for a thousand years
Colder than the moon
It's been so long

Feel my blood enraged
It's just the fear of losing you
Don't you know my name
Well, you been so long

And I've been putting out fire
With gasoline

See these eyes so red
Red like jungle burning bright
Those who feel me near
Pull the blinds and change their minds
It's been so long

Still this pulsing night
A plague I call a heartbeat
Just be still with me
Ya wouldn't believe what I've been thru
You've been so long
Well it's been so long
And I've been putting out the fire with gasoline
Putting out the fire
With gasoline

See these tears so blue
An ageless heart that can never mend
These tears can never dry
A judgement made can never bend

See these eyes so green
I can stare for a thousand years
Just be still with me
You wouldn't believe what I've been thru

You've been so long
Well it's been so long
And I've been putting out fire with gasoline
Putting out fire with gasoline

[Been so long]
[Been so long]
Well, it's been so long
[Been so long]
I've been putting out fire
[Been so long]
Well, it's been so long

I've been putting out fire
[Been so long]
It's been so long

Been so long

[Been so long, so long, so long
Been so long, so long, so long]
I've been putting out fire

[Been so long, so long, so long]
Been so long
[So long, so long]
Been so long
[So long, so long]
Been so long
[So long, so long]

Changes



I still don't know what I was waiting for
And my time was running wild
A million dead-end streets
Every time I thought I'd got it made
It seemed the taste was not so sweet
So I turned myself to face me
But I've never caught a glimpse
Of how the others must see the faker
I'm much too fast to take that test

Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes
(Turn and face the strain)
Ch-ch-Changes
Don't want to be a richer man
Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes
(Turn and face the strain)
Ch-ch-Changes
Just gonna have to be a different man
Time may change me
But I can't trace time

I watch the ripples change their size
But never leave the stream
Of warm impermanence and
So the days float through my eyes
But stil the days seem the same
And these children that you spit on
As they try to change their worlds
Are immune to your consultations
They're quite aware of what they're going through

Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes
(Turn and face the strain)
Ch-ch-Changes
Don't tell t hem to grow up and out of it
Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes
(Turn and face the strain)
Ch-ch-Changes
Where's your shame
You've left us up to our necks in it
Time may change me
But you can't trace time

Strange fascination, fascinating me
Changes are taking the pace I'm going through

Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes
(Turn and face the strain)
Ch-ch-Changes
Oh, look out you rock 'n rollers
Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes
(Turn and face the strain)
Ch-ch-Changes
Pretty soon you're gonna get a little older
Time may change me
But I can't trace time
I said that time may change me
But I can't trace time

Chant of the Ever-Circling Skeletal Family


  Brother
  Ooh-ooh
  Shake it up, shake it up
  Move it up, move it up

Bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro 

Chilly Down



When the sun goes down (when the sun goes down)
And the bads are back again (and the bads are back)
The brothers come 'round (the brothers come 'round)
I get out of my dirty bed (my dirty bed)
I shake my pretty little head (I shake my pretty little head)
I tap my pretty little feet (I tap my pretty little feet)
We are brighter than sunlight (oh)
Louder than thunder (oh)
Dancing like a yo-yo, wooh (oh)

Ain't got no problems (no problems)
Ain't got no suitcase (no suitcase)
Ain't got no clothes to worry about (no clothes to worry about)
Ain't got no real estate or jewelry or gold mines binding me, yeah

I just throw in my hand (throw in my hand)
We're the chilliest bunch in the land (in the land)
They don't look much (oh)
They're so chilly chilly (oh)
They party till they glow glow, huh (oh)

Chilly down with the fun gang
Think small with the fun gang (It's the only way)
Bang hips with the fun gang (a smile a day keeps the doctor away)
When you think it's wild
Chilly down

Chilly down with the fun gang (Hey, I don't want a job)
Think tall with the fun gang (ooh, good times)
Good times, bad food (yeah)
When you think it's wild
Chilly down, chilly down

I'm crazy, really lazy, a rollin', funky strolling, ball playing
Hips swaying, trouble making, boogie shaking, dripping, passing, jumping
Bouncing, brawling, startling, creeping, pouncing, shouting, screaming
Double-dealing, rock-n-rolling, and oh reeling
With the magic sex appeal
Can you dig that groovy feeling?

So when things get too tough (get too tough)
When your chin is dragging on the ground (dragging on the ground)
Everything down looks up (down looks up)
Bad luck
We can show you a good time (we can show you a good time)
And we don't charge nothing (nothing at all)
Just strut your nasty stuff
Wiggle in the middle, yeah
Get everybody talking, fun guy

Chilly down with the fun gang (think small)
Think small with the fun gang
Bang hips with the fun gang (hey, listen up)
When you think it's wild
Chilly down

Chilly down with the fun gang (hey, shake your pretty little head)
Think tall with the fun gang (touch your pretty little feet)
Good times, bad food (come on, come on)
When you think it's wild
Chilly down

Chilly down with the fun gang (wooh)
Think small with the fun gang
Hey, hey, with the fun gang

China Girl



I could escape this feeling, with my China Girl
I feel a wreck without my, little China Girl
I hear her heart beating, loud as thunder
Saw they stars crashing

I'm a mess without my, little China Girl
Wake up mornings where's my, little China Girl
I hear her heart's beating, loud as thunder
Saw they stars crashing down

I feel a-tragic like I'm Marlon Brando
When I look at my China Girl
I could pretend that nothing really meant too much
When I look at my China Girl

I stumble into town just like a sacred cow
Visions of swastikas in my head
Plans for everyone
It's in the whites of my eyes

My little China Girl
You shouldn't mess with me
I'll ruin everything you are
I'll give you television
I'll give you eyes of blue
I'll give you men who want to rule the world

And when I get excited
My little China Girl says
Oh baby just you shut your mouth
She says ... sh-sh-shhh

Ching-A-Ling



While walking on Red Roosters Lawn
A char-faced man I'd spy
He blew into his handkerchief
And stuttered as he sighed
I wish I'd play the doodah horn
The doodah horn is fine
I'd sell my house and ferny coach
To make this daydream mine

Doodah doo, doodah (etc.)

[Whilst flying through an azure cloud
A crystal girl I'd spy
She kissed the blue bird's honey tongue
And stuttered as she sighed
I wish to sing the Ching-A-Ling song
Ching-A-Ling song is fine
I'd give my jewels and caviar
To make this daydream mine]

[Ching-A-Ling, Ching-A-Ling, Ching-A-Ling] (etc.)

[While stepping through a heaven's eye
Two lover souls we spied
They wished the cloud boys sang to me
A cheerful happy cry
We love to play our love-strong hearts
No better do we know
No gifts of money do we give
For love is all we own]

Na na na na na na, na na na na na na na na
[Ching-A-Ling, Ching-A-Ling, Ching-A-Ling] (etc.)

Come And Buy My Toys



  Smiling girls and rosy boys
  Come and buy my little toys
  Monkeys made of gingerbread
  And sugar horses painted red

Rich men's children running past
Their fathers dressed in hose
Golden hair and mud of many acres on their shoes
Gazing eyes and running wild
Past the stocks and over stiles
Kiss the window merry child
But come and buy my toys

You've watched your father plough the fields with a ram's horn
Sowed it wide with peppercorn and furrowed with a bramble thorn
Reaped it with a sharpened scyth, threashed it with a quill
The miller told your father that he'd work it with the greatest will
Now your watching's over you must play with girls and boys
Leave the parsley on the stalls
Come and buy my toys

You shall own a cambric shirt
You shall work your father's land
But now you shall play in the market square
Till you'll be a man

  Smiling girls and rosy boys
  Come and buy my little toys
  Monkeys made of gingerbread
  And sugar horses painted red

Conversation Piece



I took this walk to ease my mind
To find out what's gnawing at me
Wouldn't think, to look at me,
that I've spent a lot of time in education
It all seems so long ago
I'm a thinker, not a talker
I've no-one to talk to, anyway

I can't see the road
for the rain in my eyes

I live above the grocers store,
owned by an Austrian
He often calls me down to eat
And he jokes about his broken English,
tries to be a friend to me
But for all my years of reading conversation,
I stand without a word to say

I can't see the bridge
for the rain in my eyes
Ahhh-huh, h...uh, huh

And the world is full of life
Full of folk who don't know me
And they walk in twos or threes or more
While the light that shines above the grocer's store
investigates my face so rudely
And my essays lying scattered on the floor
Fulfill their needs just by being there
And my hands shake, my head hurts,
my voice sticks inside my throat
I'm invisible and dumb,
no-one will recall me

And I can't see the water
through the tears in my ey-y-yes

Crack City



Oh come all you children
Don't grab that scabby hand
It belongs to Mr. Sniff and Tell
It belongs to the candyman

Don't whore your little bodies
Tthe worms of paradise
Like Everest it's fatal
Its peaks are cold as ice

They're riding on the subways
They're riding on the streets
They'll ride you down to the gutters
They'll ride you off your feet


  Gonna hit Crack City
  Hit Crack City

Piss on the icon monsters
Whose guitars bequeath you pain
They'll face you down to their level
With their addictions and their fast lanes

Corrupt with shaky visions
And crack and coke and alcohol
They're just a bunch of assholes
With buttholes for their brains

You can't keep on riding
The pain you know so well
They'll ride you down to the gutter
They'll ride you down to hell



And you the master dealer
May death be on your brow
May razors slash your mainline
I'm calling you out right now

May all your vilest nightmares
Consume your shrunken head
May the ho-ho-hoounds of paranoia
Dance upon your stinking bed

Don't look at me you fuckhead
This nation's turning blue
Its stink it fouls the highways
Its filth it sticks like glue



They'll bury you in velvet
And place you underground
The hatred of yourself
And the sufferings that conspire
To take your little body and throw it to the fools
And the hounds that rip your flesh
Only your mind can take you out of this
Only your mind or death

I'm riding on the subway
The subway down to hell
I've finished with this journey
I seem to know it well



Cracked Actor



I've come on a few years from my Hollywood Highs
The best of the last, the cleanest star they ever had
I'm stiff on my legend, the films that I made
Forget that I'm fifty cause you just got paid

Crack, baby, crack, show me you're real
Smack, baby, smack, is that all that you feel
Suck, baby, suck, give me your head
Before you start professing that you're knocking me dead

You caught yourself a trick down on Sunset and Vine
But since he pinned you baby you're a porcupine
You sold me illusions for a sack full of cheques
You've made a bad connection 'cause I just want your sex

Crack, baby, crack, show me you're real
Smack, baby, smack, is that all that you feel
Suck, baby, suck, give me your head
Before you start professing that you're knocking me dead

Criminal World



You never told me of your other faces
You were the widow of a wild cat
And now I know about your special kisses
And I know you know where that's at
I guess I recognise your destination
I think I see beneath your make-up
What you want is sort of separation
This is no ordinary
This is no ordinary
    (Ah, ah, ah)

What a criminal world
The boys are like baby-faced girls
What a criminal girl
She'll show you where to shoot your gun
What a typical mother's son
The only thing that she enjoys
Is a criminal world
Where the girls are like baby-faced boys

You've got a very heavy reputation
But no-one knows about your low-life
I know a way to find a situation
And hold a candle to your high-life disguise
You caught me kneeling at your sister's door
That was no ordinary stick-up
I'm well aware just what you're looking for
I am no ordinary
I am no ordinary
    (Ah, ah, ah)

What a criminal world
The boys are like baby-faced girls
What a criminal girl
She'll show you where to shoot your gun
What a typical mother's son
The only thing that she enjoys
Is a criminal world
Where the girls are like baby-faced boys

Crystal Japan


No lyrics for Crystal Japan

Cygnet Committee



I bless you madly, sadly as I tie my shoes
I love you badly, just in time, at times, I guess
Because of you I need to rest
Because it's you that sets the test

So much has gone and little is new
And as the sparrow sings
Dawn chorus for
Someone else to hear
The Thinker sits alone growing older
And so bitter

    "I gave Them life
     I gave Them all
     They drained my very soul...dry
     I crushed my heart to ease Their pains
     No thought for me remains there
     Nothing can They spare
     What of me?
     Who praised Their efforts to be free?
     Words of strength and care and sympathy
     I opened doors that would have blocked Their way
     I braved Their cause to guide, for little pay
     I ravaged at my finance just for Those
     Those whose claims were steeped in peace, tranquility
     Those who said a new world, new ways ever free
     Those whose promises stretched in hope and grace for me"

I bless you madly, sadly as I tie my shoes
I love you badly, just in time, at times, I guess
Because of you I need to rest, oh yes
Because it's you that sets the test

So much has gone and little is new
And as the sunrise stream
Flickers on me,
My friends talk
Of glory, untold dream, where all is God and God is just a word

    "We had a friend, a talking man
     Who spoke of many powers that he had
     Not of the best of men, but Ours
     We used him
     We let him use his powers
     We let him fill Our needs
     Now We are strong

     And the road is coming to its end
     Now the damned have no time to make amends
     No purse of token fortune stands in Our way
     The silent guns of love will blast the sky

     We broke the ruptured structure built of age
     Our weapons were the tongues of crying rage
     Where money stood
     We planted seeds of rebirth
     And stabbed the backs of fathers
     Sons of dirt

     Infiltrated business cesspools
     Hating through Our sleeves
     Yea, and We slit the Catholic throat
     Stoned the poor on slogans such as

     'Wish You Could Hear'
     'Love Is All We Need'
     'Kick Out The Jams'
     'Kick Out Your Mother'
     'Cut Up Your Friend'
     'Screw Up Your Brother or He'll Get You In the End'

     And We Know the Flag of Love is from Above
     And We Can Force You to Be Free
     And We Can Force You to Believe"

And I close my eyes and tighten up my brain
For I once read a book in which the lovers were slain
For they knew not the words of the Free States' refrain
It said:

    "I believe in the Power of Good
     I Believe in the State of Love
     I Will Fight For the Right to be Right
     I Will Kill for the Good of the Fight for the Right to be Right"

And I open my eyes to look around
And I see a child laid slain on the ground
As a love machine lumbers through desolation rows
Ploughing down man, woman, listening to its command
But not hearing anymore -
Not hearing anymore
Just the shrieks from the old rich

And I Want to Believe
In the madness that calls 'Now'
And I want to Believe
That a light's shining through
Somehow

And I Want to Believe
And You Want to Believe
And We Want to Believe
And We Want to Live
Oh, We Want to Live

We Want to Live
We Want to Live
We Want to Live
We Want to Live
We Want to Live

I Want to Live
I Want to Live
I Want to Live
I Want to Live
I Want to Live
I Want to Live

Live
Live

D.J.



I'm home, lost my job, and incurably ill
You think this is easy, realism
I've got a girl out there, I suppose
I think she's dancing
Feel like Dan Dare lies down
I think she's dancing, what do I know?

I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can't turn around no, can't turn around, no, oh, ooh
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can't turn around no, can't turn around, no, oh no

I am a D.J., I am what I play
I got believers (kiss-kiss)
Believing me, oh

One more, weekend, of lights and evening faces
Fast food, living nostalgia
Humble pie or bitter fruit

I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can't turn around no, can't turn around no, ooh

I am a D.J., I am what I say
Can't turn around no, can't turn around, ooh
I am a D.J., I am what I play
I've got believers (kiss-kiss)
Believing me

I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can turn around no, can't turn around
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can turn around no, can't turn around
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can turn around no (kiss-kiss)

Time flies when you're having fun
Break his heart, break her heart
He used to be my boss and now he is a puppet dancer
I am a D.J., and I've got believers

I've got believers
I've got believers
I've got believers in me
I've got believers
I am a D.J., I am what I play
I am a D.J.

Dancing With The Big Boys



Something's going on in society
(Dancing with the big boys)
You chew your fingers and stare at the floor
(Dancing with the big boys)
One wrong word and you're out of sync
Talking bout a hands on policy
(Big boys)
Death to the trees
(Dancing with the big boys)
They weren't bad, they weren't brave
Nothing is embarrassing
(Dancing with the big boys)
There are too many people, too much belief
(Dancing with the big boys)
Where there's trouble there's poetry
(Dancing with the big boys)
Your family is a football team
(Big boys)
This dot marks your location
(Dancing with the big boys)
Loneliness in a free society
(Dancing with the big boys)
(Big boys)
This can be embarrassing
(Big boys)
(Dancing with the big boys)
(Big boys)
(Big boys)

Day In Day Out



Day-In Day-Out
Stay-In Fade-Out

Day-In Oo Oo
Day-Out Oo Oo Oo

She was born in a handbag
   love left on a doorstep
What she lacks is a backup
   nothing seems to make a dent
Gonna find her some money honey
   try to pay her rent
That's the kind of protection everyone is shouting about


   Day-In Day-Out
   Stay-In Fade-Out

   Day-In Oo Oo
   Day-Out Oo Oo Oo

First thing she learns is she's a citizen,
   some things they turn out right
When you're under the USA
   something rings a bell and it's all over
She's going out her way
   stealing for that one good rush

Day-In Day-Out
Stay-In Fade-Out

She could use a little money
   she's hangin' on his arms like a cheap suit
she's got no money, honey
   she's the other side
Oh come on little baby
   late night, big town, police, shake down

   Oo Oo
   Oo Oo
   Day-In Day-Out
   Stay-In Fade-Out
   Oo Oo
   Oo Oo
   Day-In Day-Out
   Stay-In Fade-Out

She's got a ticket to nowhere
   she's gonna take a train ride
Nobody knows her, or knows her name
   she's in the pocket of a home boy
Oo she's gonna take her a shotgun Pow
   spin the grail spin the drug
She's gonna make them well aware
   she's an angry gal

Day-In Day-Out
Stay-In Fade-Out

Suddenly there's angels everywhere
Angels in a ton of sound
And they shootin' her down
Shootin her with video-drugs-bullets and promises

Dead Against It



And when she drowns
Within and in the fizzy gin, begins to sigh
"Good god" or "My" I cry and die and lie beside

She is the apple in my eye
She talked to god
I couldn't cope
Or'd hope eloped
A dope she roped
This salty lie


  And when she's dreaming, I believe
  And when she's reading, I retreat
  Can't believe her
  Telling me she's dead again
  Telling me she's dead against it

And deep my wound
Within for every second chance it was ?deign-torn?
From deep within, despite the rain, my words are worn

She loves to talk into the phone
No matter who
No matter when
No matter where
No better than the faulty line



Dead Man Walking



He swivels his head
Tears his eyes from the screen
As his past puts him back in Atlantic City

There's not even a demon in Heaven or Hell
Is it all just human disguise
As I walk down the aisle

And I'm gone gone gone
Now I'm older than movies
Let me dance away
Now I'm wiser than dreams
Let me fly fly fly
While I'm touching tomorrow
And I know who's there
When silhouettes fall
And I'm gone
Like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone through a crack in the past

Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking

Two young? men dancing under the lamplight
Shaking their sex and their bones
And the boys that we were
An alien nation in therapy
Sliding naked and new
Like a bad tempered child
On a rain slicked street

And I'm gone gone gone
And I'm older than movies
Oh let me dance dance dance
Now I'm wiser than dreams
Let me fly fly fly
While I'm touching tomorrow
And I know who's there
When silhouettes fall

And I'm gone

And I'm gone, like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone, through the crack in the past

Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man
Like a dead man walking

And I'm gone gone gone
Let me dance dance dance
And I'm gone gone gone
Let me dance dance dance


And I'm gone, like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone, through a crack in the past
And I'm gone, like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone, through a crack in the past

Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man
Like a dead man walking

Diamond Dogs



(spoken) This ain't rock'n'roll.  This is genocide!

As they pulled you out of the oxygen tent
You asked for the latest party
With your silicone hump and your ten inch stump
Dressed like a priest you was
Tod Browning's freak you was

Crawling down the alley on your hands and knee
I'm sure you're not protected, for it's plain to see
The diamond dogs are poachers and they hide behind trees
Hunt you to the ground they will, mannequins with kill appeal


(Will they come?)
  I'll keep a friend serene
(Will they come?)
  Oh baby, come unto me
(Will they come?)
  Well, she's come, been and gone.
  Come out of the garden, baby
  You'll catch your death in the fog
  Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
  Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs

The Halloween Jack is a real cool cat
And he lives on top of Manhattan Chase
The elevator's broke, so he slides down a rope
Onto the street below, oh Tarzie, go man go

Meet his little hussy with his ghost town approach
Her face is sans feature, but she wears a Dali brooch
Sweetly reminiscent, something mother used to bake
Wrecked up and paralyzed, Diamond Dogs are sableized



Oo-oo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs (x2)

In the year of the scavenger, the season of the bitch
Sashay on the boardwalk, scurry to the ditch
Just another future song, lonely little kitsch
(There's gonna be sorrow) try and wake up tomorrow



Ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs (x2)
Bow-wow, woof woof, bow-wow, wow
Call them the Diamond Dogs
Dogs
Call them the Diamond Dogs, call them, call them
Call them the Diamond Dogs, call them, call them, ooo
Call them the Diamond Dogs

Keep cool
Diamond Dogs rule, OK
Hey-hey-hey-hey

Beware of the Diamond Dogs 

Did You Ever Have A Dream



Did you ever have a dream or two
Where the hero is a guy named you
And the things he does are just too much
Does he fly like Mr. Superman, speak Chinese, French and Dutch?
And did you ever have a dream or two?

Have you ever woken up one day
With the feeling that you'd been away?
If the girl that you dreamed of last night
Had the same dream, in the very same scene
With the very same boy, hold tight

It's a very special knowledge that you've got, my friend
You can travel anywhere with anyone you care
It's a very special knowledge that you've got, my friend
You can walk around in New York while you sleep in Penge

I will travel round the world one night
On the magic wings of astral flight
If you've got the secret, tell me do
Have you ever had a dream or two?
Have you ever had a dream or two?

Dirty Song


No lyrics for Dirty Song

Do Anything You Say



Two by two, they go walking by
Hand in hand, they watch me cry
[Two by two, hand in hand]

Lonely nights, I dream you're there
Morning sun and you're gone
[Lonely nights, morning sun]

[Maybe] I'll do anything you say
[Maybe] I'll do anything you say
[Maybe] I'll do anything you say
Do anything you say, do anything

One desire I ask of you
Please be mine, please be mine
[One desire, please be mine]

Thousand years and I'll return
You'll be mine, you'll be mine
[Thousand years, you'll be mine]

[Maybe] I'll do anything you say
[Maybe] I'll do anything you say
[Maybe] I'll do anything you say
Do anything you say, do anything

Two by two they're walking by
Hand in hand, they watch me cry
[Two by two, hand in hand]

[Maybe] I'll do anything you say
[Maybe] I'll do anything you say
[Maybe] I'll do anything you say
Do anything you say, do anything

[Maybe] I'll do anything you say
[Maybe] I'll do anything you say
[Maybe] I'll do anything you say
Do anything you say, do anything you say

Dodo



Now we can talk in confidence
Did you guess that we've been done wrong?
Lies jump in queue to be first in line
Such a shameless design

Ah, thinks he's well screened from the man at the top
It's a shame that his children disagree
They coolly decide to sell him down the line
Daddy's brainwashing time

He's a dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me
He's a dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me

She's quite enthralled with her childhood of yore
When a unit was a figure, not a she
When lovers chose each other, now the perks are due
Another memo to screw

She's a dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me
She's a dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me

Can you wipe your nose my child
Without them slotting in your file a photograph?
Can you sleep alone at night?
Wake to find the scorching light of neighbour Jim
He's come to turn you in

Another dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me
Another dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me

Ah, another do do, no, didn't hear it
do-do, do-do,
do

Don't Bring Me Down



I'm on my own, nowhere to roam
I tell you baby, don't want no home
I wander round, feet off the ground
I even go from town to town
I said I think this rock is grand
Say I'll be your man
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down

I met this chick, the other day
And then to me, she said she'll stay
I get this pad, just like a cave
And then we'll have, our living made
And then I'll lead her on the ground
My head is spinning round
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down

I, I, I, I, I need a lover 'cause someone new
And then to her I will be true
I'll buy her furs and pretty things
I'll even buy a wedding ring
But until then I'll ?settle down?
Say I'll be your man
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Until then I'll ?settle down?
Say I'll be your man
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Don't bring me down

Don't Let Me Down & Down



Still I keep my love for you
No place to hide no way to fall
Nowhere to lie no world so wide
I'm sick and tired of telling you
Don't let me down and down and down
Don't let me down and down and down

I know there's something in the wind
That crazy balance of my mind
What kind of fool are you and I?
Scared to death and tell me why
I'm sick and tired of telling you
Don't let me down and down and down
Don't let me down and down and down

Still I keep my love for you

You made a date with destiny
You jog-jog in my memory
You haunt in mind not fade away
I'm sick and tired of telling you
Don't let me down and down and down
Don't let me down and down and down
I'm sick and tired of telling you

Still I keep my love for you
No place to hide, no way to fall
Nowhere to lie no world so wide
I'm sick and tired of telling you
Don't let me down and down and down
Don't let me down and down and down

Don't Look Down



Don't look down
They're making sorta crazy sounds
Don't look down, no
Don't know who else came to kneel
On this empty battlefield
But when I hear that crazy sound, I don't look down
>From Central Park to shanty town
I always hear that crazy sound
>From New York to shanty town
There's always something else
Don't look down, no

I went this morning to the cemetary
To see old Rudy Valentino buried
Lipstick traces on his name
He never looked down
'Cause they were making crazy sounds
>From Central Park to shanty town
He always heard that crazy sound
There's always something else
Don't look down, no

When I see you standing there
I can't see the clothes you wear
I just hear that crazy sound
And I can't look down
>From Central Park to shanty town
I've always heard that crazy sound
>From New York to shanty town
There's always something else
Don't look down, no
Don't look down
Don't look, don't look down

No I won't be bored I won't be there
Look at life it's no piece of cake
When I hear that crazy sound
I don't look down
>From Central Park to shanty town
I always hear that crazy sound
>From New York to shanty town
There's always something else
Don't look down
Don't look down, no
Well, don't look, don't look down

Don't Sit Down



Yeah, yeah, baby, yeah
Yeah, yeah, baby, yeah
Yeah, yeah, baby, yeah
Yeah
Don't sit down
Don't sit down
Don't sit down

Drive In Saturday



Let me put my arms around your head
Gee, it's hot, let's go to bed
Don't forget to turn on the light
Don't laugh babe, it'll be alright
Pour me out another phone
I'll ring and see if your friends are home
Perhaps the strange ones in the dome
Can lend us a book we can read up alone

And try to get it on like once before
When people stared in Jagger's eyes and scored
Like the video films we saw

His name was always Buddy
And he'd shrug and ask to stay
She'd sigh like Twig the Wonder Kid
And turn her face away

She's uncertain if she likes him
But she knows she really loves him
It's a crash course for the ravers
It's a Drive-in Saturday

Jung the foreman prayed at work
That neither hands nor limbs would burst
It's hard enough to keep formation with this fall out saturation
Cursing at the Astronette
Who stands in steel by his cabinet
He's crashing out with Sylvian
The Bureau Supply for ageing men
With snorting head he gazes to the shore
Which once had raised a sea that raged no more
Like the video films we saw

His name was always Buddy
And he'd shrug and ask to stay
She'd sigh like Twig the Wonder Kid
And turn her face away

She's uncertain if she likes him
But she knows she really loves him
It's a crash course for the ravers
It's a Drive-in Saturday
  

It's a Drive-in Saturday 

Dum Dum Boys




  What happened to Zeke?
  He's dead out of ??
  How about Dave?
  OD'd on alcohol
  What's Rock doing?
  Oh he's living with his mother
  What about James?
  He's going straight

Things have been tough
Without the dum dum boys
I can't seem to speak
The language
I remember how they
Used to stare at the ground
They looked as if they
Put the whole world
Looked as if they put
the whole world down

The first time I saw
the dum dum boys
I was fascinated
They just stood in front
Of the old drug store
I was most impressed
No one else was impressed
Not at all
And we'd sing
da-da-da-da-da-da
dum dum day
Where are you now my
dum dum boys are you
Alive or dead
Have you left me the last
Of the dum dum daze
Then the sun goes down
And the boys broke down

People said we were negative
They said we'd take but
we would never give
But we'd sing da-da-da
Da-da-da dum dum day
Da-da-da-da-da dum
And hope it would pay
Da-da-da-da it's been
A dumdumdum day
A dum dum day

Now I'm looking for
The dum dum boys
Where are you now
When I need your noise

Now I'm looking for
The dum dum boys
The walls close in and
I need some noise

Eight Line Poem



The tactful cactus by your window
Surveys the prairie of your room
The mobile spins to its collision
Clara puts her head between her paws
They've opened shops down West side
Will all the cacti find a home
But the key to the city
Is in the sun that pins the branches to the sky

Everything's Alright



Oh, little baby
You know I've been away
Oh, little baby
You know I'll come today
Don't you know that

Everything's alright  (everything's alright)
Everything's alright
Everything's alright  (everything's alright, babe)
Let me hold your hand and be your loving man  (all night)
Let me hold your hand and be your loving man  (all night)
Let me hold your hand and be your loving man  (all night, alright!)

Oh, little baby
You know I feel so good
Oh, little baby
I never knew I could
And don't you know that

Everything's alright (everything's alright, babe)
Everything's alright
Everything's alright (everything's alright, babe)
Let me give you loving like nobody can (all night)
Let me give you loving like nobody can (all night)
Let me give you loving like nobody can (all night, alright!)

Let me hold your hand and be your loving man
Let me hold your hand and be your loving man
Let me hold your hand and be your loving man

No, no, no, no, no, that's a-loving you
(Must have been you, I'm gonna all night loving you)
No, no, no, no, no
I'll be good for you

Everything's alright (everything's alright, babe)
Everything's alright
Everything's alright (everything's alright, babe)
Let me give you loving like nobody can (all night)
Let me give you loving like nobody can (all night)
Let me give you loving like nobody can (all night, alright!)

Everything's alright
Everything's alright
Oooh

Fall In Love With Me



You look so good to me
Here in this old saloon
Way back in West Berlin
A bottle of white wine
White wine and you
A table made of wood
And how I wish you would
Fall in love with me
Standing out in the street
With your cheap fur on
Or maybe your plastic raincoat
And your plastic shoes
They look good too
Standing in the snow
You're younger than you look
Fall in love with me
Fall in love with me
How I wish you would
A table made of wood
And a bottle of white wine
And you - and a bottle of
White wine and you
And when you're standing
In the street and it's cold
And it snows on you
And you look younger
Than you really are
I wish you would
Fall in love with me
I wish you would
Fall in love with me
I wish you would
Fall in love with me
I wish you would
Fall in love with me
Yeah
The way your eyes are black
The way your hair is black
The way your heart is young
There is just a few like you
Just the kind I need
To fall in love with me
Oh and you look so good
Yes you look so good
A bottle of white wine
A cigarette and you
Here in this saloon
White wine and you
I wish you'd fall in love with me
I wish you'd fall in love with me
Cause there's
Just a few like you
So young and real
Fall in love with me
Fall in love with me
Fall in love with me
Fall in love with me
I wish you would
You look so good
When you're young at heart
Won't you
Come to this old saloon
Come to my waiting arms
A table made of wood
And I will look at you
'Cause you're so young and pure
And you're young at heart
A bottle of white wine
And when you're tumbling down
You just look better
When you're tumbling down
You just look finer

Fame



Fame, makes a man take things over
Fame, lets him loose, hard to swallow
Fame, puts you there where things are hollow
Fame

Fame, it's not your brain, it's just the flame
That burns your change to keep you insane
Fame

Fame, what you like is in the limo
Fame, what you get is no tomorrow
Fame, what you need you have to borrow
Fame

Fame, "Nien! It's mine!" is just his line
To bind your time, it drives you to, crime
Fame

Could it be the best, could it be?
Really be, really, babe?
Could it be, my babe, could it, babe?
Really, really?

Is it any wonder I reject you first?
Fame, fame, fame, fame
Is it any wonder you are too cool to fool
Fame

Fame, bully for you, chilly for me
Got to get a rain check on pain
Fame

Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame

Fame
What's your name?

  Feeling so gay, feeling gay


Fame '90



Fame, makes a man take things over

Fame-f-fame

Fame, what you like is in the limo

Fantastic Voyage



In the event that this fantastic voyage
Should turn to erosion and we never get old
Remember it's true, dignity is valuable
But our lives are valuable too

We're learning to live with somebody's depression
And I don't want to live with somebody's depression
We'll get by, I suppose
It's a very modern world, but nobody's perfect
It's a moving world, but that's no reason
To shoot some of those missiles
Think of us as fatherless scum
It won't be forgotten
'Cause we'll never say anything nice again, will we?

And the wrong words make you listen
In this criminal world
Remember it's true, loyalty is valuable
But our lives are valuable too

We're learning to live with somebody's depression
And I don't want to live with somebody's depression
We'll get by I suppose
But any sudden movement I've got to write it down
They wipe out an entire race and I've got to write it down
But I'm still getting educated but I've got to write it down
And it won't be forgotten
'Cause I'll never say anything nice again, how can I?

Fascination



Got to use her

Every time I feel fascination
I just can't stand still, I've got to use her
Every time I think of what you pulled me through, dear
Fascination moves sweeping near me
Still I take ya


  (Fascination) fascination
  (sure 'nuff) fascination
  (takes a part of me) takes a part of me
  (Can a heart-beat) can a heart-beat
  (live in a fever) live in a fever?
  (raging inside of me?)
  (Fascination) fascination
  (oh, yeah) oh yeah
  (takes a part of me) takes a part of me
  (I can't help it) I can't help it
  (I've got to use her) got to use her
  (every time, ooh)
  Fascination comes around
  (Ooh-oo-ooh)

(Fascination) Your soul is calling
Like when I'm walking
Seems that everywhere I turn
I hope you're waiting for me
I know that people think
That I'm a little crazy
Ohh, better sex is fun
I think I like fascination
Still, tick

Fashion



There's a brand new dance but I don't know its name
That people from bad homes do again and again
It's big and it's bland full of tension and fear
They do it over there but we don't do it here

Fashion!  Turn to the left
Fashion!  Turn to the right
Oooh, fashion!

Dance with me - don't dance with me, no
Beep-beep

There's a brand new talk, but it's not very clear
Oh bop
That people from good homes are talking this year
Oh bop, fashion
It's loud and tasteless and I've heard it before
Oh bop
You shout it while you're dancing on the ole dance floor
Oh bop, fashion

Fashion! Turn to the left
Fashion! Right
Fashion!
We are the goon squad and we're coming to town
Beep-beep

Five Years



Pushing thru the market square, so many mothers sighing
News had just come over, we had five years left to cry in
News guy wept and told us, earth was really dying
Cried so much his face was wet, then I knew he was not lying
I heard telephones, opera house, favourite melodies
I saw boys, toys electric irons and T.V.'s
My brain hurt like a warehouse, it had no room to spare
I had to cram so many things to store everything in there
And all the fat-skinny people, and all the tall-short people
And all the nobody people, and all the somebody people
I never thought I'd need so many people

A girl my age went off her head, hit some tiny children
If the black hadn't a-pulled her off, I think she would have killed them
A soldier with a broken arm, fixed his stare to the wheels of a Cadillac
A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest, and a queer
  threw up at the sight of that
I think I saw you in an ice-cream parlour, drinking milk shakes cold and long
Smiling and waving and looking so fine, don't think
  you knew you were in this song
And it was cold and it rained so I felt like an actor
And I thought of Ma and I wanted to get back there
Your face, your race, the way that you talk
I kiss you, you're beautiful, I want you to walk

We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
We've got five years, what a surprise
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
We've got five years, that's all we've got

Everybody seems to nag me

More than working for the rich men (?? a thief)
Hey I'll change that scene one day
Today I might be mad
Tomorrow I'll be glad
'Cause I'll have Friday on my mind

Future Legend



And in the death
As the last few corpses lay rotting on the slimy thoroughfare
The shutters lifted in inches in Temperance Building
High on Poacher's Hill
And red mutant eyes gaze down on Hunger City
No more big wheels

Fleas the size of rats sucked on rats the size of cats
And ten thousand peoploids split into small tribes
Coveting the highest of the sterile skyscrapers
Like packs of dogs assaulting the glass fronts of Love-Me Avenue
Ripping and rewrapping mink and shiny silver fox, now legwarmers
Family badge of sapphire and cracked emerald
Any day now

The Year of the Diamond Dogs

Get Real



Oh hideous year
We angels of lead
We're dead, we're sick
Hanging by thread
Get real
Get real

You can not stop meaningful
Those teenage eyes
From deep behind fifty year old eyes
Get real
Get real


  I'm scared to touch
  Too tense to be undone
  I walk the streets
  Not expecting morning sun

Against the voice of doom
?? call all the time

I guess I should, I feel I should
Get real
Get real

What's up?
What happened when I wasn't around?
Who did what?
What went down?

Get real
Get real

Think about myself
It happens to me
It happens in the tunnel
When I let myself feel

Get real
Get real



I feel it all through breakdowns
Falling all the time
I feel I should, I guess I should

Get real
Get real
Get real
Get real

The dazzle of light
The rape of life
The seeds that curse
The ??

Girls



Girls
They come and they go
They kiss
Come and they go
Like breeze
Brushing my cheek
Like pain
Like the tears on my face

Girls
They come and they go
Like spirits
They vanish at dawn
My heart
Suspended in time
Like you
Vanish like tears in the rain

Girls
They take their loves away
Like spirits
Living so far away

Girls
Pretending to break down and cry
Girls
Whispering wind
What are they giving away

We used to be so happy
Remember, remember
So happy
I never knew
How lonely
How lonely
How lonely I could feel

Girls
They come and they go
They kiss
They come and they go
Like spirits
Brushing my cheek
Like pain
Like the tears on my face

Girls
They take their loves away
Like spirits
Living so far away

Girls
Pretending to break down and cry
Girls
Whispering wind
What are they giving away

We used to be so happy
Remember, remember
So happy
I never knew
How lonely
How lonely
How lonely I could feel

Girls

Glad I've Got Nobody



Well, I'm glad I've got nobody
Yes, I'm glad I've got nobody
Oh, I'm glad I've got nobody
To be loved by me

All the world couldn't take your place
Another girl, another face
Wouldn't be the type of thing
Know I've found it out and see
Another girl standing next to me
Oh no, just you
Oh no, just you

Well, I couldn't find another you
Everywhere I go, I see your name
I couldn't find another you
Everywhere I go, it's just the same

And I'm glad I've got nobody
Oh, I'm glad I've got nobody
Yes, I'm glad I've got nobody

Well, I'm glad I've got nobody
Oh, I'm glad I've got nobody
And I'm glad I've got nobody
To be loved by me

All the world couldn't take your place
Another girl, another face
Wouldn't be the type of thing
Know I've found it out and see
Another girl standing next to me
Oh no, just you
Oh no, just you

Well, I couldn't find another you
Everywhere I go, I see your name
Well, I couldn't find another you
Everywhere I go, it's just the same

And I'm glad I've got nobody
Yes, I'm glad I've got nobody
Really glad I've got nobody, oh

Glass Spider



Up until one century ago there lived,
In the Zi Duang provence of eastern country
A glass-like spider.
Having devoured its prey it would drape the skeletons over its web,
In weeks creating a macabre

Shrine of remains
Its web was also unique in that it had many layers,
Like floors in a buuilding

At the top of this palace-like place, assembled with almost apparent
Care, were tiny, shining objects, glass, beads, dew-drops.
One could almost call it an altar.
When the breeze blew thru this construction,
It produced sounds of wailing, crying.
Tiny wails, tiny cries.

The baby spiders would get scared and search frantically
For their mother.
But the Glass Spider would have long gone, having known that the babies
Would survive someone on their own.
Oh-The Glass Spider had blue eyes almost like-a human's.
They shed tears at the wintered turn of the centuries.

Don't you hear this wasted cry, Life is over you
(Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone)
But you've seen who's in heaven. Is there anyone in hell
(Mummy come back 'cause it's dark now)
Take care, take care.
(Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone)
Somewhere she glows divine. Somewhere she wakes alone.
But you, you've promise in your lovin' eye. God it's dark now.

Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah
Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah

Gone, Gone the water's all gone
Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone
Stay low on the ground, fire can drive you, savage and afraid
Spitting the dawn, come come come along before the animals awake
Run, run, we've been moving all night, rivers to the left.
If your mother don't love you then the riverbed might
Gone, gone, the water's all gone
Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone

Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah
Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah

Gone gone the water's all gone
Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone

God Knows I'm Good



I was walking through the counters of a national concern
And a cash machine was spitting by my shoulder
And I saw the multitude of faces, honest, rich and clean
As the merchandise exchanged and money roared
And a woman hot with worry slyly slipped a tin of stewing steak
Into the paper bag at her side
And her face was white with fear in case her actions were observed
So she closed her eyes to keep her conscience  blind

Crying
   "God knows I'm good
    God knows I'm good
    God knows I'm good
    God may look the other way today

    God knows I'm good
    God knows I'm good
    God knows I'm good
    God may look the other way today"

Then she moved toward the exit clutching tightly at her paper bag
Perspiration trickled down her forehead
And her heart it leapt inside her as the hand laid on her shoulder
She was led away bewildered and amazed
Through her deafened ears the cash machines were shrieking on the counter
As her escort asked her softly for her name
And a crowd of honest people rushed to help a tired old lady
Who had fainted to the whirling wooden floor

Crying
   "God knows I'm good
    God knows I'm good
    God knows I'm good
    Surely God won't look the other way

    God knows I'm good
    God knows I'm good
    God knows I'm good
    Surely God won't look the other way"

God Only Knows



If you should ever leave me
My life would still go on believe me
The world could show nothing to me
So what good would living do me
God only knows what I'd be without you

I may not always love you
But as long as there are stars above you
You'll never need to doubt it
I'll make you so sure about it
God only knows what I'd be without you

Golden Years



Golden years, gold whop whop whop
Golden years, gold whop whop whop
Golden years, gold whop whop whop

Don't let me hear you say life's taking you nowhere, angel
Come get up my baby
Look at that sky, life's begun
Nights are warm and the days are young
Come get up my baby

There's my baby, lost that's all
Once I'm begging you save her little soul
Golden years, gold whop whop whop
Come get up my baby

Last night they loved you, opening doors and pulling some strings, angel
Come get up my baby
In walked luck and you looked in time
Never look back, walk tall, act fine
Come get up my baby

I'll stick with you baby for a thousand years
Nothing's gonna touch you in these golden years, gold
Golden years, gold whop whop whop
Come get up my baby

Some of these days, and it won't be long
Gonna drive back down where you once belonged
In the back of a dream car twenty foot long
Don't cry my sweet, don't break my heart
Doing all right, but you gotta get smart
Wish upon, wish upon, day upon day, I believe oh lord
I believe all the way
Come get up my baby

There's my baby, lost that's all
Once I'm begging you save her little soul
Golden years, gold whop whop whop
Come get up my baby

Don't let me hear you say life's taking you nowhere, angel
Come get up my baby
Run for the shadows, run for the shadows
Run for the shadows in these golden years

I'll stick with you baby for a thousand years
Nothing's gonna touch you in these golden years, gold
Golden years, gold whop whop whop (11 times)

Good Morning Girl



Hey, hey, good morning girl
Hey, hey, good morning girl
Hey, hey, good morning girl
But I can't pass this time of day

'Cause I'm on my way to rest my head
And I've lost the mind that I used to have
And I don't have a dime to spare

Hey, hey, good morning girl
Hey, hey, good morning girl
Hey, hey, good morning girl
But I can't pass this time of day

So go tell the man that collects the dues
That you saw a guy without any shoes
Who would do the job if he was built that way

Hey, hey, good morning girl
Hey, hey, good morning girl
Hey, hey, good morning girl
But I can't pass this time of day, no
I can't pass this time of day

'Cause I'm on my way to rest my head
And I've lost the mind that I used to have
I don't have a dime to spare

Hey, hey, good morning girl
Hey, hey, good morning girl
Hey, hey, good morning girl
But I can't pass this time of day

So go tell the man that collects the dues
That you saw a guy without any shoes
Who would do the job if he was built that way

Hey, hey, good morning girl
Hey, hey, good morning girl

Goodbye Mr. Ed



The ghost of Manhattoes
Shrieking as they fall
From AT&T
Someone sees it all
Goodbye Mr. Ed
Andy's skull enshrined
In a shopping mall near Queens
Someone sees it all

Icarus takes his pratfall
Bruegel on his head
Goodbye Mr. Ed

Four and twenty black kids
Some of them are blind
Someone sees it all
Tolerance of violence
By the fellows with no heads
Goodbye Mr. Ed

 (twice)
  Some things are so big
  They make no sense
  Histories so small
  People are so dense
  Someone sees it all
  Goodbye Mr. Ed

Never mind the Pistols
They laid the Golem eggs
Others came to hatch them
Outside the pale
Someone sees it all
Goodbye Mr. Ed

Growin' Up



Well I stood stonelike at midnight
Suspended in my masquerade
I combed my hair till it was just right
And commanded the night brigade
I was open to pain and crossed by the rain
And I walked on a crooked crutch
I strolled all alone through a fallout zone
Came out with my soul untouched

I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd
But when they said `Sit down' I stood up
Ooh-ooh growin' up

The flag of piracy flew from my mast
My sails were set wing to wing
I had a jukebox graduate for first mate
She couldn't sail but she sure could sing
I pushed the B-52 and bombed `em with the blues
With my gear set stubborn on standing
I broke all the rules, strafed my old high school
Never once gave thought to landing, no

I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd
But when they said `Come down' I threw up
Ooh-ooh growin' up

I took month-long vacations in the stratosphere
And you know it's really hard to hold your breath
And I swear I lost everything I ever loved or feared
I was the cosmic kid in full costume dress
Well my feet finally took root in the earth
But I got me a nice little place in the stars
And I swear I found the key to the universe
In the engine of an old parked car

I hid in the mother breast of the crowd
But when they said `Move down' I moved up
Ooh-ooh, doncha know that I'm growin' up
Ooh-ooh, I can't help it that I'm growin' up

Growing Up And I'm Fine

Hang On To Yourself



Well she's a tongue twisting storm, she will come to the show tonight
Praying to the light machine
She wants my honey not my money she's a funky-thigh collector
Layin' on 'lectric dreams


So come on, come on, we've really got a good thing going
Well come on, well come on, if you think we're gonna make it
You better hang on to yourself

We can't dance, we don't talk much, we just ball and play
But then we move like tigers on vaseline
Well the bitter comes out better on a stolen guitar
You're the blessed, we're the spiders from Mars

 (x3)

Come on, ah, come on, ah 

Hang Onto Yourself (Arnold Corns version)

Heaven's In Here



Baby I dream between the blade and the tongue
Of the rose on your cheek the wounded and dumb
We stumble and fall we stumble and fall
Skin on skin but there's heaven in...


  Heaven's in here
  Heaven's in here
  Among the twilight and stars
  Like a rocket to mars
  Heaven in here

The first and the last are telling it all
Telling you loud but selling it small
I'm taking a swing at this shadow of mine
Crucifix hangs an' my heart's in my mouth
But it's here



Heaven in one sigh
Heaven in two eyes

Heaven lies between your marbled thighs
The rustle of your falling gown
We stumble and fall like tragedy falls
We stumble and twirl there's heaven in here
We stumble and fall uncertain we fall
Flesh on flesh but there's heaven in...
Heaven's in here



You'll dance to my tongue we'll dance on the sun
We're the twilight and stars
There's heaven in here

Helden



Du
Koenntest Du schwimmen
Wie Delphine
Delphine es tun
Niemand gibt uns eine Chance
Doch wir koennen siegen
Fuer immer und immer
Und wir sind dann Helden
Fuer einen tag

Ich
Ich bin dann Koenig
Und Du
Du Koenigin
Auch wenn sie
Unschlagbar scheinen
Werden wir Helden
Fuer einen Tag
Wir sind dann wir
An diesem Tag

Ich
Ich glaub' das zu traeumen
die Mauer
Im Ruecken war kalt
Schuesse peitschen die Luft
Doch wir kuessen
Als ob nichts geschieht
Und die Scham fiel auf ihre Seite
Oh, wir koennen sie schlagen
Fuer alle Zeiten
Dann sind wir Helden
Nur diesen Tag
Dann sind wir Helden
Dann sind wir Helden

Here Comes The Night



Ohhhhh... here it comes
Here comes the night
Yeah, here comes the night
Oh, yeah (here comes the night)

I can see right out my window walking down the street my girl
With another guy
His arms around her like it used to be with me
Oh it makes me want to die


  Yeah, here it comes
  Here comes the night
  Yeah, here comes the night
  Yeah... (here comes the night)

There they go, funny how they look so good together
Wonder what is wrong with me
Why can't I accept the fact she's chosen him
And simply let them be?



Oh she's with him they're turning down the lights
Now he's holding her the way I used to do
I can see her closing her eyes and telling him lies
Exactly like she told me too

 

Here Today, Gone Tomorrow



You're like a sailor with a girl on every shore
Stay with her now for they won't see you no more
Like a gypsy forever on the run
Stay for a while you look for a whore

Like that sailor leaves, come back again
Stay for a while and they won't see you again
Like that gypsy caravan, forever on the run
You stay for a while, then you pick up and go


  That's how you show your love for me
  That's how you show your love for me, you're like
  Here today, gone tomorrow
  Each time you come, you leave a little sorrow, you're like
  Here today, gone tomorrow
  Each time you come, you leave a little sorrow

You're like that big big star that's torn the town apart
Leaving everyone to console their aching heart
Like that snow that fell, looks so wrong and out of place
Stay for a while and then you leave without a trace

That's 'xactly like that star that tore the town apart
Leaving everyone to console their aching heart
Like that snow that fell, looks so wrong and out of place
Stay for a while and then you leave without a trace

That's how you show your love for me
That's how you show your love for me
Here today, gone tomorrow
Each time you come, you leave a little sorrow, you're like
Here today, gone tomorrow
Each time you stay, you leave a little sorrow

Here today, gone tomorrow, hmmm
You're like
Here today, gone tomorrow
Each time you come, you leave a little sorrow
Here today, gone tomorrow
Each time you come, you leave a little sorrow

Here today
Here today, but gone tomorrow

Standing, by the wall (by the wall)
And the guns, shot above our heads (over our heads)
And we kissed, as though nothing could fall (nothing could fall)
And the shame, was on the other side
Oh we can beat them, for ever and ever
Then we could be Heroes, just for one day

We can be Heroes
We can be Heroes
We can be Heroes
Just for one day
We can be Heroes

Hideaway



I need to touch
A live unbeaten earth
So that's where I'm going

I know a town
In North-West Mexico
Where the sun is gold
And life exists
Hideaway, hideaway, truly
Hideaway, hideaway, truly

My country got
Raped by big industry
We'll just have to wing it

The concrete strips
Raw creed and king TV
They say, 'So what'
I say 'So this'
Hideaway, hideaway, truly
Hideaway, hideaway, truly

I can hear children's voices
Ringing in a yard
When I hear children's voices
My feelings aren't so hard

Your honest face
Your quiet simple grace
You are one thing
I will not waste
Hideaway, hideaway, truly
Hideaway, hideaway, truly

Holy Holy



Listen baby, let me lie low, lie low with you
To be lie-high-high-high
High-high lie-low lie
Slowly, it's good and holy
Helping one another, just a righteous brother
Lifetime, give me back my lifetime
I don't want to be an angel, just a little bit evil
Feel the devil in me

Holy, holy
Hold on to anyone, hold on to anyone
But just let me be
Holy, holy
Hold on to anyone, hold on to anyone
But let go of me

Listen baby, let me lie low, lie low with you
To be a lie-high-high-high
High-high my oh my

Holy, holy
Hold on to anyone, hold on to anyone
But just let me be
Holy, holy
Hold on to anyone, hold on to anyone
But let go of me

I Am A Laser



I saw him by the D.J.
The way he danced was cool
They said that I stood no chance
They called me little fool
Well here I am before ya
And all your friends can see
Him roasting like a turkey
It's just this flame in me
And no-one can burn like me

I am a laser
Burning through your eyes
And I know what kind of man you are
And I long to hold you tight
I am a laser
Knowing right from wrong
And I know what kind of heart you have
A heart so big and strong

I dreamt how much I lay on ya
Sitting by your side
Driving in my ?????
Going for a ride
I'm going to turn my beam on
If only for an hour
You'll know I've switched the heat on
When you feel my golden shower
And no-one can burn like me

I am a laser
Burning through your eyes
And I know what kind of man you are
And I long to hold you tight
I am a laser
Knowing right from wrong
And I know what kind of heart you have
A heart so big and strong

I know what the boys call me
They think I'm black barberella
But only one beam do I have
And that's this heart beat of mine

I am a laser
Burning through your eyes
And I know what kind of man you are
And I long to hold you tight
I am a laser
Knowing right from wrong
And I know what kind of heart you have
A heart so big and strong

I Am Divine



So you think I'm dressed to impress you
Say I walk a little too tall
I think I may caress you
And show you how I fall
Got my vines(?) at the right time
One step ahead of y'all

I walk a fine line
Pay my price and you'll be mine
'Cause I'm so divine

I'm the mainman in my city
Hey Jim, I'm in control
?????
?????
Don't you want to feel it
Don't you want it all

I walk a fine line
Pay my price and you'll be mine
'Cause I'm so divine

I walk a fine line
Pay my price and you'll be mine
'Cause I'm so divine

I Am With Name



I was
Ramona A. Stone
I started with no enemies of my own
I was an artiste
In a tunnel
But I've been having a mid-life crisis
And I've been dreaming in a sleep
And ape men with metal parts
I've spat upon deeply felt age
I've hid my hearts in
And I hate the funny colored english
We'll creep togeher you and I
For I know who the small friends are

I Can't Explain



New feeling inside
It's a hot certain kind
I feel hot and cold
Down in my soul, baby

I can't explain
Going out of my mind
Dizzy in the head, and I'm feeling blue
Things you say well maybe they're true
I get funny dreams again and again
Knows what it means, but

Can't explain
I think it's love
Say it to you
When I feel blue

I can't explain, no, I can't explain

You know I can't explain
I'm going out of my mind
Well I'm a worried guy
But I can't explain

I Can't Read



I can't read and I can't write down
I don't know a book from countdown
I don't care which shadow gets me
All I've got is someone's face

Money goes to money heaven
Bodies go to body hell
I just cough, catch the chase
Switch the channel watch the police car


I can't read shit anymore
I just sit back and ignore
I just can't get it right, can't get it right
I can't read shit I can't read shit

When you see a famous smile
No matter where you run your mile
To be right in that photograph
Andy where's my fifteen minutes



I Dig Everything



I've got the village I love
I walk along beside the garbagemen and I dig everything
I wave to the policemen, but they don't wave back
They don't dig anything
Ain't had a job for a year or more and I don't know a thing
Everything's spent and I dig everything
Everything's spent and I dig everything
Dig

I feed the lions in Trafalgar Square and I dig everything
I've sit just behind my window, till my cigarettes were low and dug
everything
Got a backstreet room in the bad part of town and I dig everything
I'd see people in the street below, who don't know where they're going
They don't dig anything
Everything's spent and I dig everything
Everything's spent and I dig everything
Dig

I've got more friends than I've had had dinners
Some of them were losers, but the rest of them are winners
Rick, John, Sally, a connection named Paul
Holy low on money, their intentions are tall
We smoke and talk in my room and we dig everything
Dig

I've made myself at home
I've made good friends which the time-check girl on the end of the phone
All the movie shows
I sunbathe for love
Even when it's not too hot
'Cause I dig everything
Oh yeah

I Feel Free



Dear when I dance with you
We move like the sea
You, you're all I want to know
I feel free
I feel free

I can walk down the street
there's no one there
the pavement is one huge crowd
I can drive down the road
my eyes can't see
but my mind wants to cry out loud

I can walk down the street
there's no one there
the pavement is one huge crowd
I can drive down the road
my eyes can't see
but my mind wants to cry out loud
My mind wants to cry out loud

I feel free

Dance floor is like the sea
The ceiling is the sky
You're the sun, and as you shine on me
I feel free
I feel free
I feel free

I Have Not Been To Oxford Town



Baby Grace is the victim
She was 14 years of age
And the wheels are turning, turning
For the finger points at me
All's well
But I have not been to Oxford Town
All's well
No I have not been to Oxford Town

Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
All's well
20th century dies

And the prison priests are decent
My attorney seems sincere
I fear my days are numbered
Lord get me out of here
All's well
But I have not been to Oxford Town
All's well
But I have not been to Oxford Town

Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
All's well
20th century dies

This is your shadow on my wall
This is my flesh and blood
This is what I could've been

And the wheels are turning and turning
As the 20th century dies

If I had not ripped the fabric
If time had not stood still
If I had not met Ramona
If I'd only paid my bill
All's well
But I have not been to Oxford Town
All's well
But I have not been to Oxford Town

Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
All's well
20th century dies

This is my bunk with two sheets
This is my food though foul
This is what I could have been

Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
All's well
20th century dies

Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
All's well
20th century dies
All's well
20th century dies
All's well

All's well, all's well
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
All's well
20th century dies
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
All's well
20th century dies

I Keep Forgettin'



I keep forgetting you don't love me no more
I keep forgetting you don't want me no more
I keep forgetting that you told me that you
Didn't want me around any more
But these stupid old feet
Just head for your street
Like they've done so many times before
And this stuborn old fist
On the end of my wrist
Keeps a knocking on your front door

I keep forgetting you don't love me no more
I keep forgetting you don't want me no more
I keep forgetting bout those heartbreaking nights
And those heartbreaking things
That you said
Though I know in my heart
We're drifting apart
I can't believe that our love is dead
Though it's plain as can be
That you're finished with me
I just can't get it through my head

I Know It's Gonna Happen Someday



My love wherever you are
Whatever you are, don't lose faith
I know it's gonna happen someday
to you
Please wait
Please wait
Wait, don't lose faith
You say that the day never arrives
And it's never seemed so far away
But I know it's gonna happen someday
to you
Please wait
Please wait
Wait, don't lose faith
Please wait
Please wait
Please, don't lose faith
Don't lose faith

You say that the day never arrives
And it seems so far away
But I know it's gonna happen someday
Someday to you
To you
Please wait

I'm Deranged



Funny how secrets travel
I'd start to believe if I were to bleed
Thin skies, the man chains his hands held high
Cruise me blond
Cruise me babe
A blond belief beyond beyond beyond
No return No return

I'm deranged
Deranged my love
I'm deranged down down down
So cruise me babe cruise me baby


  And the rain sets in
  It's the angel-man
  I'm deranged

Cruise me cruise me cruise me babe

The clutch of life and the fist of love
Over your head
Big deal Salaam
Be real deranged Salaam
Before we reel
I'm deranged

 (two times)

Cruise me cruise me cruise me babe

I'm deranged

I'm Not Losing Sleep



Yes, I've read the morning papers
Telling me that you've made money
Do you think I'm gonna crawl, then think again

Though I'm dressed in rags, I'm richer
Though I eat from tins, I'm healthier
Though I live in slums, I'm purer than you, my friend

Too bad, I'm not losing sleep
[Too bad] I'm just counting sheep
[Too bad] I'm not losing sleep, my friend

Look around and see the friends
The ones you left, our friends deserted
See the guys that used to talk and drink with you

Don't look down your nose at me
'Cause I won't ask your sympathy
I won't be your yes-sir man for anything

Too bad, I'm not losing sleep
[Too bad] I'm just counting sheep
[Too bad] I'm not losing sleep, my friend

I would walk with you
Talk with you, drink with you
If you drop that halo that you're wearing on the ground

Too bad, I'm not losing sleep
[Too bad] I'm just counting sheep
[Too bad] I'm not losing sleep, my friend

I can't get my satisfaction
Knowing you won't get reaction
What makes me the big attraction anyway

It's too bad, I'm not losing sleep
[Too bad] I'm just counting sheep
[Too bad] I'm not losing sleep, my friend

Too bad, I'm not losing sleep
[Too bad] I'm just counting sheep
[Too bad] I'm not losing sleep, my friend

Oh, it's too bad, I'm not losing sleep
[Too bad] I'm just counting sheep
[Too bad] I'm not losing sleep, my friend

If There Is Something



If there is something
That I might find
Look around corners
Try to find peace of mind, I say
"Where would you go
If you were me?
Trying to keep a straight course is not easy"

Somebody special
Looking at me
Same kind of reaction
Warning about me
What it might try to be
Too easy to say
Being specific's just a game
It's just a game-ame-ame-ame

I would do anything for you
I would come all day
I would swim all the oceans blue

I would walk a thousand miles
Reveal my secrets
More than enough for me to share
I will put roses around your door
Sit in the garden
Growing potatoes by the score

Shake your head girl, with your ponytail
Takes me right back [when you were young]
Throw your precious gifts into the air
Watch them fall down [when you were young]

Lift up - lift up your feet and put them on the ground
You used to walk upon [when you were young]

Lift up - lift up your feet and put them on the ground
The hills were higher [when you were young]

Lift up - lift up your feet and put them on the ground
The trees were taller then [when you were young]

Lift up - lift up your feet and put them on the ground
The grass was greener [when you were young]

Your love could feel you with devotion
Used to walk upon [when you were young]

In The Heat Of The Morning



The blazing sunset in your eyes will tantalize
Every man who looks your way
I watched them sink before your gaze
Seniorita sway
Dance with me before their frozen eyes
I'm so much in love
Like a little soldier catching butterflies


  No man loved like I love you
  Wouldn't you like to love me too
  In the heat of the morning
  In the shadow I'll clip your wings
  And I'll tell you I love you
  In the heat of the morning

I'll tie a knot in rainbow's end, organise the breeze
Light my candle from the sun
I'll give you daylight for a friend
I'll do all of these
I'll prove that it can be done, oh, I'm so much in love
Like the ragged boy who races with the wind



In the heat of the morning
In the shadow I'll clip your wings
And I'll tell you I love you
In the heat of the morning

Oh yeah, all day, all the way

Ooh

Isolation



Needed you
You were only using
Needing you just
Tore me down
Here I stand
In isolation
Feeling emptiness and doubt
Walking down the
Broken highway
Sucking sugar
Plain and sweet
Did your mother
Ever tell you
That the joyful are free

I need some lovin'
Like an inmate needs a dime
I need some lovin'
Like a poet needs a rhyme
Here I stand in isolation
My empty hands - in isolation
Walking down the
Broken highway
Sucking sugar
'Cause it's my way

Find me one heart
To complete with
Heading for the
Farthest beaches
I need some lovin'
Like a body needs a soul
I need some lovin'
Like a fastball needs control
Here I stand in isolation
My empty hands - in isolation
Strike up the band
In this proud land

Got a lot to do
Got a lot to say
Got a life to live
Here I stand -
In isolation

It Ain't Easy



When you climb to the top of the mountain
Look out over the sea
Think about the places perhaps, where a young man could be
Then you jump back down to the rooftops
Look out over the town
Think about all of the strange things circulating round

It ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy to get to heaven when you're going down

Well all the people have got their problems
That ain't nothing new
With the help of the good Lord
We can all pull on through
We can all pull on through
Get there in the end
Sometimes it'll take you right up and sometimes down again

It ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy to get to heaven when you're going down

Satisfaction, satisfaction
Keep me satisfied
I've got the love of a Hoochie Koochie woman
She calling from inside
She's a-calling from inside
Trying to get to you
All the woman really wants you can give her something too

It ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy to get to heaven when you're going down
  (repeat x2)

It's Gonna Be Me



Hey Jack I better shake it off. put her out of my head
Thinking I balled just another young girl last night
Oh brother! I left a woman in that morning bed
Been on that trip so many times
Good god! was it really yesterday?

I've tried so many, many, many, many, many, many ways
I've lied and taken off into the day
Leaving another girl to weep over the breakfast tray
Loved her before I knew her name, hit me Jack, 'cause I'm
Gonna love her way


  (Come back, my babe)
  Come back, my babe
  Be holy again, I gave her
  (I gave her) Ooh, maybe, maybe
  (Ooh maybe) Gotta give her, ooh baby, baby (Ooh baby)
  That kind of love
  Can only destroy, I gave her
  (I gave her) Ooh maybe, maybe
  (Ooh maybe) Get it down if I'm gonna be her baby, 'cause
  (Ooh baby)
  Gonna be me
  (It's gonna be me)

There was no rein to check me
When all of those little things walked on by
Oh! But I couldn't really stammer out a word
When that angel stuck in my mind
Oooooh, looking for love won't hold me back
(No!) I'm gonna love her way



Just playing that latest record
Waiting for the telephone to ring
Wiped out and bitter with a bag clutched in her hand
All the cars sound like they're pulling in the drive
Hmmm, no, no, no

I see her now
A little tear running down her cheek
Lost, let down
People looking for me
I want to race down her street
And knock hard, hard, hard on the door until
Until she breaks down into my arms like a
Treasured toy and I feel her pain
I'll be so strong, again and again

Come back my baby
I'm hold you again, I'll take you
(I'll take you) Ooh, baby, baby, baby
(Ooh baby) We're gonna have, ooh baby, baby (Ooh baby)
My kind of love
Can only bring you joy, I'm gonna
(I'm gonna) Yeah, baby
(Ooh baby) Yeah, I'll give you baby, baby (Ooh baby)
'Cause it's gonna be me (It's gonna be me)
Hmmmm

It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City



I had skin like leather and the diamond-hard look of a cobra
I was born blue and weathered but I burst just like a super-nova
I could walk like Brando into the sun, and dance just like a Casanova
With my black-jack and jacket and my hair slicked sweet
Silver studs on my duds just like a Harley in heat
When I strut down the street I can hear its heartbeat
The sisters fell back and said "Don't that man look pretty"
The cripple on the corner cried out "Penny, nickels for your pity"
Them gasoline boys down-town, they sure talk gritty
It's so hard to be a saint in the city

I was the king of the alley, mama, I could talk some trash
I was the Prince of the Paupers, crowned down-town at the Beggars' Bash
I was a pimp's main prophet, I kept everything cool
Just a back-street gambler with the luck to lose
And when the heat came down it was left on the ground, mama
Devil appeared to me like Jesus through the steam in the street, and
Showed me a hand that even the cops couldn't beat
And I felt his hot breath on my neck as I dove into the heat, and
It's so hard to be a saint when you're just a poor boy out on the street

And the sages of the subway sit just like the living dead
As the tracks clack out the rhythm, the eyes fixed straight ahead
They ride the line of balancing, hold on by just a thread
Well, it's too hot in these tunnels, you can get hit up by the heat
When you get up to get out at your next stop
  but they push you right down in your seat
And your heart starts beatin faster as you struggle to your feet
Then you're out of that hole! Back on the street
And them south-side sisters, they sure look pretty
And the cripple on the corner cries out "Nickels for your pity"
And them down-town boys, they sure talk gritty
It's so hard to be a saint in the city

It's No Game (Part 1)

Shiruetto ya kage ga kakumei o miteiru
Mo tengoku no giyu no kaidan wa nai

Silhouettes and shadows watch the revolution
No more free steps to heaven
It's no game

Ore genjitsu kara shime dasare
Nani ga okkote irunoka wakara nai
Doko ni kyokun wa arunoka
Hitobito wa yubi o orareteiru
Konna dokusaisha ni iyashime rareru nowa kanashii

I am bored from the event
I really don't understand the situation
And it's no game

Documentaries on refugees
Couples 'gainst the target
You throw a rock against the road
And it breaks into pieces
Draw the blinds on yesterday, and it's all so much scarier
Put a bullet in my brain, and it makes all the papers

Nammin no kiroku eiga
Hyoteki o se ni shita koibito tachi
Michi ni ishi o nage reba
Kona gona ni kudake
Kino ni huta o sureba
Kyohu wa masu
Ore no atama ni tama o buchi kome ba
Shinbun wa kaki tateru

There's always tomorrow when people have their fingers broken
To be insulted by these fascists - it's so degrading
And it's no game

Shutup!   Shutu...

It's No Game (Part 2)



Silhouettes and shadows watch the revolution
No more free steps to heaven
Just walkie-talkie - heaven or hearth
Just big heads and drums - full speed and pagan
And it's no game

I am barred from the event
I really don't understand the situation
So where's the moral
People have their fingers broken
To be insulted by these fascists it's so degrading
And it's no game

Documentaries on refugees, couples 'gainst the target
Throw a rock against the road, and it breaks into pieces
Draw the blinds on yesterday, and it's all so much scarier
Put a bullet in my brain, and it makes all the papers

And it's no game

Children round the world, put camel shit on the walls
They're making carpets on treadmills, or garbage sorting

And it's no game

Janine



Oh my love, Janine
I'm helpless for your smile
Like a Polish wander
I travel ever onwards to your land
And were it not just for the jewels, I'd close your hand

Your strange demand
To 'collocate' my mind
Scares me into gloom
You're too intense
I'll have to keep you in your place
I've no defence
I've got to keep my veil on my face

Janine, Janine, you'd like to know me well
But I've got things inside my head
That even I can't face

Janine, Janine, you'd like to crash my walls
But if you take an axe to me
You'll kill another man
Not me at all

You're fey, Janine
A tripper to the last
But if I catch you standing on my toes
I'll have a right to shout you down
For you're a lazy stream
In which my thoughts would drown

So stay, Janine
And we can glid along
I've caught your wings for laughs
I'm not obliged to read you statements of the year
So take your glasses off
And don't act so sincere

Janine, Janine, you'd like to know me well
But I've got things inside my head
That even I can't face

Janine, Janine, you'd like to crash my walls
But if you take an axe to me
You'll kill another man
Not me at all

Joe The Lion



Joe the lion
Went to the bar
A couple of drinks on the house an' he said
"Tell you who you are if you nail me to my car"

Boy
Thanks for hesitating
This is the kiss off

Boy
Thanks for hesitating
You'll never know the real story
Just a couple of dreams
You get up and sleep

You can buy god it's Monday
Slither down the greasy pipe
So far so good no one saw you
Hobble over any freeway
You will be like your dreams tonight

You get up and sleep
You get up and sleep
Joe the lion
Made of iron

Joe the lion
Went to the bar
A couple of drinks on the house an' he was
A fortune teller he said
"Nail me to my car and I'll tell you who you are"

Joe the lion, yeah yeah
Went to the bar, yeah yeah
A couple of dreams and he was
A fortune teller he said
"Nail me to my car tell you who you are"

You get up and sleep
The wind blows on your check
The day laughs in your face
Guess you'll buy a gun
You'll buy it secondhand
You'll get up and sleep

Oh lordy, oh lordy, you know I need some loving

She turns me on, but I'm only dancing
She turns me on, don't get me wrong

John I'm Only Dancing (Again)



(Dancing) I'm having so much love
(Dancing) Too bad my back had gone
(Dancing) Boogie down with daddy now
I'd give my house in the country
If you slept, it's so funky
(Music) I'm dancing in the street
(Oooh, music) I've torn my shoes from my feet
(Romancing) It's got me dirty and sweet
It's got you reeling and rocking
Won't you let me slam my thing in

(Falling) I think it's all I can do
(Falling) Just got me feeling it too
(Ooh, falling) Give a little, take a little, give a little back
Jumping John, the great goose has gone
Got a lion on my hand, a Charlie on my back

(John) I'm only dancing
(She turns me on) I'm only dancing
(She turns me on) Ooh, but she moves me
(Don't get me wrong) I-I-I-I-I
(I'm only dancing, ooh-ooh)
(I'm only dancing, ooh-ooh)

(Dancing) Have you heard the news?
(Dancing) President has got the blues
(Dancing) I tell you confidently
If he gives it to you, he'd better take it from me

(Sad sad) I'll pick up your bones
(Sad sad) Leave the numbers alone
(Sad sad) Get off your telephone
Looking people in the eye, tell them "my, oh, my"
Let your backbone slide while you whistle and cry

(John)
(She turns me on)
(She turns me on) love, love, love, we get
(Don't get me wrong) hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
I'm only dancing, ooh-ooh

Join The Gang



Let me introduce you to the gang
Johnny plays the sitar, he's an existentialist
Once he had a name, now he plays our game
You won't feel so good now that you've joined the gang

Molly is the model in the ads
Crazy clothes and acid full of soul and crazy hip
Someone switched her on, then her beam went wrong
Cause she can't switch off now that she's joined the gang

Arthur is a singer with a band
Arthur drinks two bottles just before he goes on stage
Look at Arthur rave, all the kids are paid
They want to see the croaking man who joined the gang

You won't be alone, we've all got beery grins
It's a big illusion but at least you're in
At least you're in

This club's called The Webb, it's this month's pick
Next month we shall find a place where prices aren't so stiff
15 bob a coke, 'fraid that's past a joke
This is how to spend now that you've joined the gang

This is what to do now that you're here
Sit round doing nothing all together very fast
Psychedelic stars, throwing down cigars
They're picking up the joints now that they've joined the gang

Julie



Julie
Oh
And I know

Like a mirror, Sunday morning
When the dark clouds hung above
I saw you kneeling 'neath a garden
I saw the grim and stood above

What kind of meaning in a gun shot
It doesn't matter what they say
I never felt I aimed at no one
And who's gonna take the gun away

Julie
Pretend for me
That I'm someone in your life

Julie
I'm yours till the end
All the days and memories

I'm not a man of single reason
It's in every single man
This beat of jealous retribution
And every spurned heart makes its plan

Well, I know that you really loved him
And I know that if there's a God above
Through million times we'll remember
How the trail slips away

Julie
Pretend for me
Even only for a while

Julie
My soul is on the line
All the days and memories

Julie
Remember me
All the days of your life

Julie
I'm lost over you
Passion always ends this way
End this way

Jump They Say



When comes the shaking man
A nation in his eyes
Striped with blood and emblazed tattoo
Streaking cathedral spire

They say
	he has no brain
They say
	he has no mood
They say
	he was born again
They say
	look at him climb
They say 'Jump'

They say
	he has two gods
They say
	he has no fear
They say
	he has no eyes
They say
	he has no mouth

They say hey that's really something
They feel he should get some time
I say he should watch his ass
My friend don't listen to the crowd
They say 'Jump'

Got to believe somebody
Got to believe

Karma Man



Fingertip sun at sideshow stalls, they throw the balls
At coconut fur that hides behind
Coloured shades that blind your eyes
Every child's mother holds an ice-cream cone, they circle round
Perceived unknown by an eye that peers from a hole in the tent where no one goes
A figure sitting cross-legged on the floor
He's clogged and clothed in saffron robes
His beads are all he owns

Slow down, slow down
Someone must have said that slowed him down
Slow down, slow down
It's pictured on the arms of the Karma Man

Fairy tale skin, depicting scenes from human zoos
Impermanent toys like peace and war
A gentle face you've seen before
Karma Man tattooed on your side, the wheel of life
I see my times and who I've been
I only live now and I don't know why
I struggle hard to take these pictures in, but
All my friends can see is just the pinkness of his skin

Slow down, slow down
Someone must have said that slowed him down
Slow down, slow down
It's pictured on the arms of the Karma Man

Slow down, slow down
Someone must have said that slowed him down
Slow down, slow down
It's pictured on the arms of the Karma Man

Kingdom Come



Well I walked in the pouring rain
And I heard a voice that cries "It's all in vain"
The voice of doom was shining in my room
I just need one day somewhere far away
Lord I just need one day

Well I'll be breaking these rocks
And cutting this hay
Yes I'll be breaking these rocks
What's my price to pay

Well the river's so muddy, but it may come clear
And I know too well what's keeping me here
I'm just the slave of a burning ray
Oh give me the night, I can't take another sight
Please, please give me the night



Sun keeps beating down on me, wall's a mile high
Up in the tower they're watching me hoping I'm gonna die

I won't be breaking no rocks
I said "I won't be breaking no rocks"

(I won't be breaking no rocks) Oh-oh-oh
(I won't be breaking no rocks) Oh-oh-oh
(I won't be breaking no rocks)
When the kingdom comes (repeat ad inf)

Knock On Wood



I don't want to lose the good thing that I've got
If I do, I will surely, I will lose a lot

For your love is better than any love other I've know
It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
I better knock on wood
Baby

I got superstitious about you, but I can't take change
You got me spinning, baby, spinning in a trance
But your love is better than any other love I've known
It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
You better knock on wood

It's no secret, but that woman fills my lovin' cup
She sees, so ready, that I get enough
And her love is better than any other love I've known
It's like thunder
It's like lightning
The way you love me is frightening
I better knock on wood
Baby

Better, yes, better
(Yes you better knock, knock, knock on wood) Yes, I better
(Yes you better knock, knock, knock on wood) Oh, knock on wood
(Yes you better knock, knock, knock on wood) You know I would, would
(Yes you better knock, knock, knock on wood) It's no secret
(Yes you better knock, knock, knock on wood) No, oh, better
(Yes you better knock, knock, knock on wood) Hangin' above me
(Yes you better knock, knock, knock on wood) I can't leave her
(Yes you better knock, knock, knock on wood) Oh no, baby
Knock on wood, WOO!

Kooks



Will you stay in our Lovers' Story
If you stay you won't be sorry
'Cause we believe in you
Soon you'll grow so take a chance
With a couple of Kooks
Hung up on romancing

Will you stay in our Lovers' Story
If you stay you won't be sorry
'Cause we believe in you
Soon you'll grow so take a chance
With a couple of Kooks
Hung up on romancing

We bought a lot of things to keep you warm and dry
And a funny old crib on which the paint won't dry
I bought you a pair of shoes
A trumpet you can blow
And a book of rules
On what to say to people when they pick on you
'Cause if you stay with us you're gonna be pretty Kookie too

Will you stay in my Lovers' Story
If you stay you won't be sorry
'Cause we believe in you
Soon you'll grow so take a chance
With a couple of Kooks
Hung up on romancing

And if you ever have to go to school
Remember how they messed up this old fool
Don't pick fights with the bullies or the cads
'Cause I'm not much cop at punching
Other people's Dads
And if the homework brings you down
Then we'll throw it on the fire
And take the car downtown

Will you stay in our Lovers' Story
If you stay you won't be sorry
'Cause we believe in you
Soon you'll grow so take a chance
With a couple of Kooks
Hung up on romancing  (repeat chorus ad inf.)

Lady Grinning Soul



She'll come, she'll go.  She'll lay belief on you
Skin sweet with musky odour
The lady from another grinning soul

Cologne she'll wear. Silver and Americard
She'll drive a beetle car
And beat you down at cool Canasta

And when the clothes are strewn don't be afraid of the room
Touch the fullness of her breast.  Feel the love of her caress
She will be your living end

She'll come, she'll go.  She'll lay belief on you
But she won't stake her life on you
How can life become her point of view

And when the clothes are strewn don't be afraid of the room
Touch the fullness of her breast.  Feel the love of her caress
She will be your living end (repeat)

Lady Stardust



People stared at the makeup on his face
Laughed at his long black hair, his animal grace
The boy in the bright blue jeans
Jumped up on the stage
And lady stardust sang his songs
Of darkness and disgrace


  And he was alright, the band was altogether
  Yes he was alright, the song went on forever
  And he was awful nice
  Really quite out of sight (second time: really quite paradise)
  And he sang all night long

Femme fatales emerged from shadows
To watch this creature fair
Boys stood upon their chairs
To make their point of view
I smiled sadly for a love I could not obey
Lady stardust sang his songs
Of darkness and dismay



Oh how I sighed when they asked if I knew his name



Law (Earthling On Fire)



I don't want knowledge, I want certainty (x3)

In the street a man shouts out loud
A wallet drops and money flies into the midday sun

With the sound, with the sound, with the sound of the ground (x3)
Oh I get a little bit afraid
Sometimes

Earthlings on fire (x2)


  With the sound, with the sound, with the sound of the ground (x3)
  Sure I get a little bit afraid

Sometimes

Earthlings on fire (x4)

I don't want knowledge, I want certainty (x2)

In a house a man drops dead
As he hits the floor he sighs
"What a morning"

 (x2)

Sometimes

Earthlings on fire (repeat to last verse as backing vocals)

Oh I get a little bit afraid
Sometimes

I don't want knowledge, I want certainty (x2)
Oh I get a little bit afraid
Sometimes

I don't want knowledge, I want certainty (x2)
I don't want knowledge

Let Me Sleep Beside You



Baby, baby, brush the dust of youth from your shoulder
Because the years of fretting days are right behind you now
Don't return to fields of green where rainbow secrets were told
Place your ragged doll with all the toys and things and deeds
I will show you a game where the winner never wins


  Let your hair hang down, wear the dress your mother wore
  Let me sleep beside you

Lock away your childhood and throw away the key
For now the streets and city sounds will burn your eyes as coals
We shall drink the oldest wine and velvet skies will linger
Child, you're a woman now, your heart and soul are free
I will boldly light that lamp and we shall walk together



Your darkened eyes throw mystery
But your lips are void of history
You could not imagine that it could happen this way, could you
I will give you dreams and I'll tell you things you'll like to hear



Let me sleep beside you

Let's Dance



Let's dance, put on your red shoes and dance the blues
Let's dance, to the song they're playin' on the radio

Let's sway, while colour lights up your face
Let's sway, sway through the crowd to an empty space

If you say run, I'll run with you
If you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you
Would break my heart in two
If you should fall
Into my arms
And tremble like a flower

Let's dance, for fear your grace should fall
Let's dance, for fear tonight is all

Let's sway, you could look into my eyes
Let's sway, under the moonlight, this serious moonlight

If you say run, I'll run with you
If you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you
Would break my heart in two
If you should fall
Into my arms
And tremble like a flower

Let's dance, put on your red shoes and dance the blues
Let's dance, to the song they're playin' on the radio

Let's sway, you could look into my eyes
Let's sway, under the moonlight, this serious moonlight

Let's Spend The Night Together



Well, don't you worry 'bout what's been on my mind
I'm in no hurry I can take my time
I'm going red and my tongue's getting tired
Out of my head and my mouth's getting dry
I'm h-h-h-high


  Let's spend the night together
  Now I need you more than ever
  Let's spend the night together now

I feel so strong that I can't disguise, oh my
Well, I just can't apologise, no
Don't hang me up but don't let me down
We could have fun just by fooling around, and around and around



Oh
You know I'm smiling baby
You need some guiding baby
I'm just deciding baby



This doesn't happen to me every day
No excuses I've got anyway, heh
I'll satisfy your every need
And I'll know you'll satisfy me, oh my-my-my my-my

THREE TIMES:
  Let's spend the night together
  Now I need you more than ever

Let's spend the night together
They said we were too young
Our kind of love was no fun
But our love comes from above
Do it!
Let's make love
Hoo!



Letter to Hermione



The hand that wrote this letter
Sweeps the pillow clean
So rest your head and read a treasured dream
I care for no one else but you
I tear my soul to cease the pain
I think maybe you feel the same
What can we do?
I'm not quite sure what we're supposed to do
So I've been writing just for you

They say your life is going very well
They say you sparkle like a different girl
But something tells me that you hide
When all the world is warm and tired
You cry a little in the dark
Well so do I
I'm not quite sure what you're supposed to say
But I can see it's not okay

He makes you laugh
He brings you out in style
He treats you well
And makes you up real fine
And when he's strong
He's strong for you
And when you kiss
It's something new
But did you ever call my name
Just by mistake?
I'm not quite sure what I'm supposed to do
So I'll just write some love to you

Life On Mars?



It's a god-awful small affair
To the girl with the mousy hair
But her mummy is yelling "No"
And her daddy has told her to go
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
Now she walks through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And she's hooked to the silver screen
But the film is a saddening bore
For she's lived it ten times or more
She could spit in the eyes of fools
As they ask her to focus on

Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man! Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the Lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?

It's on Amerika's tortured brow
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
Now the workers have struck for fame
'Cause Lennon's on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibeza to the Norfolk Broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother, my dog, and clowns
But the film is a saddening bore
'Cause I wrote it ten times or more
It's about to be writ again
As I ask you to focus on

Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man! Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the Lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?

Lightning Frightening



I'll give you back my farm and I'll give you back my house
I'll give you back my right to be free
I've got moon, I've got sun
Lightning, lightning, lightning
I've got me, I've got you
Frightening, frightening, frightening

I'll give you back my farm and I'll give you back my house
I'll give you back my right to be free
I'll give you back my farm and I'll give you back my house
I'll give you back my right to be free
I've got moon, I've got sun
(I've got) Lightning, lightning, lightning
I've got me, I've got you
(It's) Frightening, frightening, frightening

Like A Rolling Stone



Yeah
How does it feel
How does it feel

Once upon a time you dressed so fine
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you
People called, say "Beware doll, you're bound to fall"
Thought they were all kidding you
You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hanging out
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging for your next meal

How does it feel
How does it feel
To be without a home
Like a complete unknown
Just like a rolling stone

You've gone to the finest school, Miss Lonely
But you know you only used to get juiced in it
No one ever taught you how to live on the street
You're gonna have to get used to it
You said you'd never compromize
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And you ask him if you want to make a deal

How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
Like a complete unknown
Just like a rolling stone

Tell me
Tell me
Tell me
Yeah

"Oh, rock Ronno, rock"

You never turned around to catch the frowns on the jugglers and clowns
When they all did their tricks for you
You never understood that it ain't no good
To let other people get your kicks for you
You used to ride a chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard to discover that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything he could steal

How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
Like a complete unknown
To be without a home
Just like a rolling stone
Just like a rolling stone
Just like a rolling stone

Little Bombardier



War made him a soldier
Little Frankie Mear
Peace left him a loser
The little bombardier

Lines of worry appeared with age
Unskilled hands that knew no trade
Spent his time in the picture house
The little bombardier

Frankie drank his money
The little that he made
Told his woes to no man
Friendless, lonely days

Then one day, in the ABC
Four bright eyes gazed longingly
At the ice-cream in the hand of
The little bombardier

Sunshine entered our Frankie's days
Gone his worries, his hopeless maze
His life was fun and his heart was full of joy

Two young children had changed his aims
He gave them toffees and played their games
He brought them presents with every coin he made

Then two gentlemen called on him
Asked him for his name
Why was he friends with the children
Were they just a game?

Leave them alone or we'll get sore
We've had blokes like you in the station before
The hand of authority said "no more" to
The little bombardier

Packed his bags, his heart in pain
Wiped a tear and caught a train
Not to be seen in the town again
The little bombardier

Little Miss Emperor



You're not giving an inch
You're not strung like wire
Your open arms they flinch
Joan Crawford style
Treated like a towel
Inside you howl

On some dark concrete
Midnight street
You've built an altar
That's quite complete
Your self control
Is damned amazing
You're trying hard
And I want you
Little Miss Emperor

You really want to grow
And you're alert, I know
But babies mostly drown
It's a company town
Cheat gods and joke
Attack your noble ghost

I saw the best minds
Of my generation
Learn how to crawl
Across our nation
Conformity falls
Like one wet blanket
Look how we live
And I want you
Little Miss Emperor
Little Miss Emperor
Trying to open doors

Little Toy Soldier



Once upon a time there was a toy soldier
And he lived in the playroom
Once upon a time there was a toy soldier
With a whiplash in his hand

And every night little girl Sadie would take all her clothes off
And wind up the toy solider
And he'd raise his whip and say to her


  "On your knees, little Sadie
  Little Sadie, on your knees
  Taste the whip, and love not given lightly
  Taste the whip, and bleed for me"

Little Sadie loved her little toy soldier
And she'd run home from school each day
Little Sadie loved her little toy soldier
And she'd lock the door so she could play

Little Sadie got ambitious and
Wound the clockwork soldier tighter
So he could whip her harder and harder



One day, Sadie wound and wound
And wound and wound
And wound and wound
Till suddenly
The little toy soldier's spring went
  Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo
  Arrgghhhh!

Little Wonder



Stinky weather, Fat shaky hands
Dopey morning Doc, Grumpy gnomes
Little wonder then, little wonder
You little wonder, little wonder you

Big screen dolls, tits and explosions
Sleepytime, Bashful but nude
Little wonder then, little wonder
You little wonder, little wonder you

I'm getting it

Intergalactic, see me to be you
It's all in the tablets, Sneezy Bhutan
Little wonder then, little wonder
You little wonder, little wonder you

Mars happy nation, sit on my karma
Dame meditation, take me away
Little wonder then, little wonder
You little wonder, little wonder you


  Sending me so far away, so far away
  So far away, so far away (x4)
  So far away, so so far away
  So far away, so far away
  So far away, so so far away

  Little wonder
  You little wonder, you
  Little wonder
  You little wonder you

You little wonder, little wonder you
Little wonder then, little wonder
You little wonder, little wonder you

London Bye Ta-Ta




  London bye ta-ta
  Strange young town
  London bye ta-ta
  Brought me down
  Don't like your new face
  That's not nice
  Got to go far far
  London bye ta-ta

Gigi, Gigi
Take me away
Gigi, Gigi
Take me today
The boys in the clothes shop
Sold me curry for a pound
His cardboard face is soggy
And his selling thorny crowns

I loved her!
I loved her!
I've got to get away now
But I loved her!



Red light, green light
Make up your mind
Red light, green light
You're far too un-kind
She loves to love all beauty
And she says the norm is funny
But she whimpers in the morning
When she finds she has no money

I loved her!
I loved her!
I've got to get away now
But I loved her!
Ahhh!





Oh, London bye ta-ta
Oh, London bye ta-ta
Oh, ehh

Look Back In Anger



"You know who I am," he said
The speaker was an angel
He coughed and shook his crumpled wings
Closed his eyes and moved his lips
"It's time we should be going"

(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
Look back in anger, driven by the night
Till you come
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
Look back in anger, see it in my eyes
Till you come

No one seemed to hear him
So he leafed through a magazine
And, yawning, rubbed the sleep away
Very sane he seemed to me

(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
Look back in anger, driven by the night
Till you come
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
Look back in anger, feel it in my voice
Till you come

(Waiting so long, ahhh...)
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so) 

Looking For A Friend



Hmm ah (giggle)

Gather round all you people
Watch me while you can
I've been trawling too long
I've been losing out strong
For the strength of another man

[I've been hasty, wasty
Sitting on the backstep
Waiting for the phone to ring]
This semi-acoustic love affair
Is driving me to the brink

I'm just looking for a friend
I'm just looking for a friend
You don't have to be a big wheel
You don't have to be the end
I'm just looking for
Looking for a friend

God help all you ladies
May the devil take all you men
You're far too busy having babies
To help yourselves to a friend

[You're lazy, crazy
Hung upon the insane
Standing with your back to the wall]
My pretty has a picture, oh-so nice
Hoping that you might call

I'm just looking for a friend
I'm just looking for a friend
You don't have to be a big wheel
You don't have to be the end
I'm just looking for
Looking for a friend

Hey
Hey looking

I'm just looking for a friend
I'm just looking for a friend
Oh, you don't have to be a big wheel
You don't have to be the end
I'm just looking for
Looking for a friend

Looking
Just a-cruising
Vulgar
Just looking (giggle)

Don't have to be a big wheel
Don't have to be the end
I'm just looking for
Looking for a friend

Oh yeah (etc.)

Looking For Satellites



REFRAIN (twice, sung as backing vocals)
  Nowhere
  Shampoo
  TV
  Come back
  Boy's own
  Slim tie
  Showdown
  Can't stop

Where do we go from here?
There's something in the sky
Shining in the light
Spinning and far away

REFRAIN (backing vocals, x4)


  Satellite

  Looking for satellites
  Looking for satellites

Where do we go to now?
There's nothing in our eyes
As lonely as a moon
Misty and far away

Louie, Louie Go Home



Well, I- well, I left my wife and child

Love Song



The words I have to say
May well be simple but they're true
Until you give your love
There's nothing more that we can do

Love is the opening door
Love is what we came here for
Noone can offer you more
You know what I mean
Have your eyes really seen?

VERSE
  You say you find it hard
  To lead the life that we once knew
  But there's no other way
  So now it's really up to you

 (x2)
  Love is the key we must turn
  Truth is the flame we must burn
  Freedom the lesson we must learn
  Do you know what I mean?
  Have your eyes really seen?

VERSE

 (x2)

Cha, cha, cha, cha, cha, cha

Love You Till Tuesday



Just look through your window, look who sits outside
Little me is waiting, standing through the night
When you walk out through your door I'll wave my flag and shout

Ohh, beautiful baby
My burning desire started on Sunday
Give me your heart and I'll love you till Tuesday

Da da da dum (x4)

Who's that hiding in the apple tree, clinging to a branch
Don't be afraid it's only me, hoping for a little romance
If you lie beneath my shade, I'll keep you nice and cool

Ohh, beautiful baby
I was very lonely till I met you on Sunday
My passion's never-ending and I'll love you till Tuesday

Da da da dum (x7)

Let the wind blow through your hair, be nice to the big blue sea
Don't be afraid of the man in the moon, because it's only me
I shall always watch you until my love runs dry

Ohh, beautiful baby
My heart's aflame, I'll love you till Tuesday
My head's in a whirl and I'll love you till Tuesday
Love, love, love, love you till Tuesday
Love, love, love, love you till Tuesday

Da da da dum (x11)

Well, I might stretch it till Wednesday

Loving The Alien



Watching them come and go
The templars and the saracens
They're traveling the holy land
Opening telegrams

Torture comes and torture goes
Knights who'd give you anything
They bear the cross of coeuf de leon
Salvation for the mirror blind

But if you pray all your sins are hooked upon the sky
Pray and the heathen lie will disappear
Prayers they hide the saddest view
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)
And your prayers they break the sky in two
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)
You pray til the break of dawn
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)
And you'll believe you're loving the alien
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)

Thinking of a different time
Palestine a modern problem
Bounty and your wealth in land
Terror in a best laid plan

Watching them come and go
Tomorrows and the yesterdays
Christians and the unbelievers
Hanging by the cross and nail

Lucy Can't Dance



Lucy I know what you're going to going to do
Oh Lucy look what you're doing I'm doing it too
Now you're looking for God in exciting new ways
I say trust Him at once which is something these days

Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do
Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do

Did the world just explode?
Don't recognize anyone
But you've still got me under your thumb

Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do

Pursuing your frenzy in Ritz or Savoy
In this sexual noise, vicious chords offer joy
You live and you die in the blink of an eye
Well I can't make you dance
Dance to the noise

Lucy can't dance but she knows what the noise can do
Dance to the noise
Lucy can't dance but she knows what the noise can do

Lucy I know what you're going to going to do
But you can't buy me off in this serial world
Who who who died and made you material girl?

Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do

So I'll spin while my lunatic lyric goes wrong
Guess I'll put all my eggs in a postmodern song

Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do

Or this shallow orb mugged by reality
Just a few simple words like I love you, I need you
Live and you die in the blink of an eye
Still I can't make you dance
Dance to the noise

Lucy can't dance but she knows what the noise can do

Lust For Life



Here comes Johnny Yen again
With the liquor and drugs
And the flesh machine
He's gonna do another striptease
Hey man where'd you get
That lotion? I been hurting
Since I bought the gimmick
About something called love
Yeah something called love
That's like hypnotizing chickens
Well I am just a modern guy
Of course I've had it in the ear before
'Cause of a lust for life
'Cause of a lust for life
I'm worth a million in prizes
With my torture film
Drive a G.T.O.
Wear a uniform
All on a government loan
I'm worth a million in prizes
Yeah I'm through with sleeping on the
Sidewalk - no more beating my brains
With the liquor and drugs
With the liquor and drugs
Well I am just a modern guy
Of course I've had it in the ear before
'Cause of a lust for life
'Cause of a lust for life
I got a lust for life
Got a lust for life
Oh a lust for life
Oh a lust for life
A lust for life
I got a lust for life
I got a lust for life
Well I am just a modern guy
Of course I've had it in the ear before
'Cause of a lust for life
'Cause of a lust for life
'Cause of a lust for life

Here comes Johnny Yen again
With the liquor and drugs
And the flesh machine
He's gonna do another striptease
Hey man where'd you get
That lotion? Your skin starts
Itching once you buy the gimmick
About something called love
Oh love love love
That's like hypnotizing chickens
Well I am just a modern guy
Of course I've had it in the ear before
'Cause of a lust for life
'Cause of a lust for life
Got a lust for life
Yeah a lust for life
I got a lust for life
Oh a lust for life
I got a lust for life
Yeah a lust for life
I got a lust for life
A lust for life
Lust for life
Lust for life

Magic Dance



You remind me of the baby
What baby? the baby with the power
What power? power of voodoo
Who do? you do
Do what? remind me of the baby

I saw my baby, crying hard as babe could cry
What could I do?
My baby's love had gone
And left my baby blue
Nobody knew:


  What kind of magic spell to use?
  Slime and snails
  Or puppy dogs' tails
  Thunder or lightning
  Then baby said
  Dance magic, dance (dance magic, dance)
  Dance magic, dance (dance magic, dance)
  Put that baby spell on me
  Jump magic, jump (jump magic, jump)
  Jump magic, jump (jump magic, jump)
  Put that magic jump on me
  Slap that baby, make him free

I saw my baby, trying hard as babe could try
What could I do?
My baby's fun had gone
And left my baby blue
Nobody knew



Dance magic, dance (dance magic, dance) (x4)
Jump magic, jump (jump magic, jump) (x2)

Put that baby spell on me (ooh)

You remind me of the baby
What baby? the baby with the power
What power? power of voodoo
Who do? you do
Do what? remind me of the baby

Dance magic, dance, ooh ooh ooh
Dance magic, dance magic, ooh ooh ooh
Dance magic

What kind of magic spell to use?
Slime and snails
Or puppy dogs' tails
Thunder or lightning
Something frightening

Dance magic, dance
Dance magic, dance
Put that baby spell on me
Jump magic, jump
Jump magic, jump
Put that magic jump on me
Slap that baby make him free
Dance magic, dance (dance magic, dance)

Dance magic, dance (dance magic, dance)
Dance magic, dance (dance magic, dance)
Dance magic, dance
Slap that slap that baby make him free
Dance magic, dance (dance magic, dance) (repeat ad-lib)

Maid Of Bond Street



This girl is made of lipstick
Powder and paint
Sees the pictures of herself
Every magazine on every shelf

This girl is maid of Bond Street
Hailing cabs, lunches with executives
Gleaming teeth sip aperitifs

This girl is a lonely girl
Takes the train from Paddington to Oxford Circus
Buys the Daily News
But passengers don't smile at her, don't smile at her

This girl is made of loneliness
A broken heart
For the boy that she once knew
Doesn't want to know her any more

And this girl is a lonely girl
Every thing she wants is hers
But she can't make it with the boy she really wants to be with
All the time, to love, all the time

This boy is made of envy
Jealousy
He doesn't have a limousine
Really wants to be a star himself

This girl, her world is made of flashlights and films
Her cares are scraps on the cutting room floor

And maids of Bond Street drive round in chauffered cars
Maids of Bond Street picture clothes, eyes of stars
Maids of Bond Street shouldn't have worldly cares
Maids of Bond Street shouldn't have love affairs

Man In The Middle



Like an inventor
He is a symbol of a new age
He glides above the realms
Of you and me
He flows through your life
And makes you feel quite small
You may sit up in your chair
He doesn't care at all

He's the man in the middle
You can tell which way he lays
He's the man in the middle
And he realises
And he realises
And he realises
Beauty pays

His gowns come from Paris
Occasionally from Rome
He can go anywhere
Say back to his home
He flows through your life
And makes you feel quite small
Flashing to the white collars
Ha, he doesn't care at all

He's the man in the middle
You can tell which way he lays
He's the man in the middle
And he realises
And he realises
And he realises
Beauty pays
Please...

He's the man in the middle
You can tell which way he lays
He's the man in the middle
And he realises
And he realises
And he realises
Beauty pays

He's the man in the middle
You can tell which way he lays
He's the man in the middle
And he realises
And he realises
And he realises
Beauty pays
Please...

Mass Production



Before you go
Do me a favour
Give me a number
Of a girl almost like you
With legs almost like you
I'm buried deep in mass production
You're not nothing new
I like to drive along the freeways
See the smokestacks belching
Breasts turn bronw
So warm and so brown

Though I try to die
You put me back on the line
Oh damn it to hell
Back on the line - hell
Back on the line
Again and again
I'm back on the line
Again and again
And I see my face here
And it's there in the mirror
And it's up in the air
And I'm down on the ground

By the way
I'm going for cigarettes
And since you've gotta go
Won't you do me that favour
Won't you give me that number
Won't you get me that girl
Yeah, she's almost like you
Yes, she's almost like you
And I'm almost like him
Yes, I'm almost like him
Yes, I'm almost like him
Yeah, I'm almost like
    him

Memory of a Free Festival



The Children of the summer's end
Gathered in the dampened grass
We played Our songs and felt the London sky
Resting on our hands
It was God's land
It was ragged and naive
It was Heaven

Touch, We touched the very soul
Of holding each and every life
We claimed the very source of joy ran through
It didn't, but it seemed that way
I kissed a lot of people that day

Oh, to capture just one drop of all the ecstasy that swept that afternoon
To paint that love upon a white balloon
And fly it from the toppest top of all the tops
That man has pushed beyond his brain
Satoria must be something just the same

We scanned the skies with rainbow eyes and saw machines of every shape and size
We talked with tall Venusians passing through
And Peter tried to climb aboard but the Captain shook his head
And away they soared
Climbing through the ivory vibrant cloud
Someone passed some bliss among the crowd
And We walked back to the road, unchained

"The Sun Machine is Coming Down, and We're Gonna Have a Party
 The Sun Machine is Coming Down, and We're Gonna Have a Party
 The Sun Machine is Coming Down, and We're Gonna Have a Party
 The Sun Machine is Coming Down, and We're Gonna Have a Party
 The Sun Machine is Coming Down, and We're Gonna Have a Party."

Miracle Goodnight



Burning up each others' love, burning up our lives
Tried all kinds of working out, miracle goodnight
Future full and empty knocking on my door
Ragged limbed and hungry mama
Miracle no more

(Skin tell me) turn it around
(Head tell me) make it alright
(Nobody dancing)

Morning star you're beautiful, yellow dime on high
Spin you round my little room, miracle goodnight
Evening flower all alone, puzzling capeche
Haven't got a death wish, just want a little more


  (Skin tell me) turn it around
  (Head tell me) make it alright
  (Nobody dancing) miracle goodnight
  (Breath tell me) turn it around
  (Heart tell me) make it alright
  (Nobody dancing) it was only make believe

I wish I was a sailor a thousand miles from here
I wished I had a future, anywhere

I love you in the morning sun, I love you in my dreams
I love the sound of making love, the feeling of your skin
The corner of your eyes, I long forevermore
I never want to say goodnight, miracle goodnight



Don't want to know the past, I want to know the real deal
I really don't want to know that
The less we know, the better we feel

Morning star you're beautiful, yellow diamond high
Spinning around my little room, miracle



(Skin tell me) turn it around
(Moon tell me) make it alright
(Nobody dancing) it was only make believe

(Eyes tell me) turn it around
(News tell me) make it alright
(Nobody dancing)



Modern Love



I catch a paper boy
But things don't really change
I'm standing in the wind
But I never wave bye-bye

But I try, I try

There's no sign of life
It's just the power to charm
I'm lying in the rain
But I never wave bye-bye

But I try, I try

Never gonna fall for


  Modern love - walks beside me
  Modern love - walks on by
  Modern love - gets me to the church on time
  Church on time - terrifies me
  Church on time - makes me party
  Church on time - puts my trust in god and man
  God and man - no confessions
  God and man - no religion
  God and man - don't believe in modern love

It's not really work
It's just the power to charm
I'm still standing in the wind
But I never wave bye bye

But I try, I try

 (x2)

Modern love - Modern love (x12)

Modern love - Modern love, walks beside me
Modern love - Modern love, walks on by
(repeat 3 more times)

Moonage Daydream



I'm an alligator, I'm a mama-papa coming for you
I'm the space invader, I'll be a rock 'n' rollin' bitch for you
Keep your mouth shut, you're squawking like a big monkey bird
And I'm busting up my brains for the words

Keep your 'lectric eye on me babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream oh yeah!

Don't fake it baby, lay the real thing on me
The church of man, love, is such a holy place to be
Make me baby, make me know you really care
Make me jump into the air

Keep your 'lectric eye on me babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream oh yeah!
  (repeat x3)

Freak out, far out, in out

Moonage Daydream (Arnold Corns version)



Come on strong, girl
Oh, lay your heavy trip on me
The church of man, love
Is such a holy place to be
Make me, baby
Make me know you really care
Make me jump into the air


  Keep your 'lectric eye on me babe
  Put your ray gun to my head
  Press your space face close to mine, love [oh no]
  Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah!

Oh, right on!
Come on, you mothers!
Far out!

Keep your mouth shut
And listen to the word inside
Keep your head on
And open up your eyes real wide
Keep the change, love
Let me fix it for you inside
There isn't any room to hide

 (x2)

Ow!
Uhhh
Uhhh
Uhhh
Take it all, take it all
Ahhh!
Ahhh!
Pretty
Uhh (etc...)

Move On



Sometimes I feel
The need to move on
So I pack a bag
And move on
Move on

Well I might take a train
Or sail at dawn
Might take a girl
When I move on
When I move on

Somewhere, someone's calling me
When the chips are down
I'm just a travelling man
Maybe it's just a trick of the mind, but
Somewhere there's a morning sky
Bluer than her eyes
Somewhere there's an ocean
Innocent and wild

Africa is sleepy people
Russia has its horsemen
Spent some nights in old Kyoto
Sleeping on the matted ground

Cyprus is my island
When the going's rough
I would love to find you
Somewhere in a place like that

Somewhere, someone's calling me
When the chips are down
I stumble like a blind man
Can't forget you
Can't forget you

Feeling like a shadow
Drifting like a leaf
I stumble like a blind man
Can't forget you
Can't forget you

Can't forget you
Can't forget you

Music Is Lethal





My Death



My death waits like an old Drouet
So confident I'll go his way
Whistle to him and the passing time
My death waits like a bible truth
At the funeral of my youth
We drank for that and the passing time
My death waits like a witch at night
As surely as our love is bright
Let's not think about the passing time


  But what ever lies behind the door
  There is nothing much to do
  Angel or devil, I don't care
  For in front of that door, there is you

My death waits like a beggar blind
Who sees the world through an unlit mind
Throw him a dime for the passing time
My death waits there between your thighs
Your cool fingers will close my eyes
Let's not think of that and the passing time
My death waits to allow my friends
A few good times before it ends
So let's drink to that and the passing time



My death waits there among the leaves
In magician's mysterious sleeves
Rabbits and dogs and the passing time
My death waits there among the flowers
Where the blackest shadow, blackest shadow cowers
Let's pick lilacs for the passing time
My death waits there in a double bed
Sails of oblivion at my head
So pull up the sheets against the passing time



Nathan Adler



Old Touchschriek was the main nameserver
Suspected of being a shoulder surfer
But he didn't know from shit
About challenge response systems
Now Ramona A Stone we know was selling interest drugs
She got males all hung up on her mind filters
She was if you don't mine me saying so an update demon
Now Leon
He couldn't wait for 12 o'clock midnight
He jumps up on the stage
With a criss criss machete
And slashes around cutting a zero on everything
I mean a zero in the fabric of time itself
Was this a suspect?
I says to myself
Woa!  "Quelle courage!"
Oh wait, I'm getting ahead of myself
Let me take you back to when it all began

Neighborhood Threat



Down where your paint is cracking
Look down you backstairs buddy
Somebody's living there and
He don't really feel the weather
And he don't share your pleasures
No he don't share your pleasures
Look at his eyes
Did you see his crazy eyes
You're so surprised he don't run to catch your ash
Everybody always wants to kiss your trash

You can't help him
Nobody can
Now that he knows
There's nothing to get
Will you still place your bet
On the neighborhood threat

Somewhere a baby's bleeding
Somewhere a mother's needing
Outside a boy is lying
But mostly he is crying
And he just shouts in anger
You'll find him interesting
Look at his eyes
Did you see his crazy eyes
You're so surprised he doesn't build for you
Everybody always wants to run with you

Never Let Me Down



When I believed in nothing   I called her name
Trapped in a high-dollar joint in some place   I called her name
And though my days are slipping by
And nights so cruel I thought I'd die
She danced her little dance 'till it made me cry
She was shakin' like this honey doing that

When I needed soul revival   I called your name
When I was falling to pieces   I screamed in pain

Your soothing hand that turned me round
A love so real swept over me
You danced your little dance 'till it made me cry
You were shakin' like this honey doing that

Never let me down   She never let me down
Never let me down   She never let me down

When all your faith is failing   Call my name
When you've nothing coming   Call my name

I'll be strong for all it takes
I'll cover your head till the bad stuff breaks
I'll dance my little dance till it makes you smile
Shaking like this honey doing that

Never let you down   I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down   I'll never let you down

New York's In Love



Do you see that thing
I'm sure it's love
Would you do one thing
New York's in love
The city grew wings in the back of the night
The clouds are stuck like candy-floss
She sees the rich trash having all the fun
Makes her wonder where they get the energy from
There's nothing you can do to her
This  city's all clean and waiting
I don't mean to wait too long
But this joint can't get much higher


  New York's in love-
  With her big green eyes
  And her long blonde hair
  New York's in flames
  New York's in love
  With the way she talks
  And the way she walks
  New York's in love
  Goo Goo Goo Goo Goo Goo

My, oh my, it's a tom-tom beat
No-one knows they've had their day
We can dance and we can see the singles swing
Everybody's waiting for the Go-Go Boys.
You're turned to stone by the family
It's now the dead speak to the living
Nothing left here but a raging blaze
I don't mean to wait too long


  New York's in love-
  With her big green eyes
  And her long blonde hair
  New York's in flames
  New York's in love
  With the way she talks
  And the way she walks
  New York's in love
  Goo Goo Goo Goo Goo Goo

Night Clubbing



Nightclubbing we're nightclubbing
We're what's happening
Nightclubbing we're nightclubbing
We're an ice machine
We see people brand new people
They're something to see
When we're nightclubbing
Bright-white clubbing
Oh isn't it wild?

Nightclubbing we're nightclubbing
We're walking through town
Nightclubbing we're nightclubbing
We walk like a ghost
We learn dances brand new dances
Like the nuclear bomb
When we're nightclubbing
Bright white clubbing
Oh isn't it wild...

Nite Flights



There's no hold
The moving has come through
The danger passing you
Turns its face into the heat and runs the tunnels
It's so cold
The dark dug up by dogs
The stiches torn and broke
The raw meat fist you choke
Has hit the bloodlite

Glass traps open and close on nite flights
Broken necks feather weights press the walls
Be my love, we will be gods on nite flights
With only one promise, only one way to fall

Glass traps open and close on nite flights
Broken necks feather weights press the walls
Be my love, we will be gods on nite flights
With only one promise, only one way to call

On nite flights
Only one way to fall

No Control



Stay away from the future
Back away from the light
It's all deranged - no control

Sit tight in your corner
Don't tell God your plans
It's all deranged
No control

If I could control tomorrow's haze
The darkened shore wouldn't bother me
If I can't control the web we weave
My life will be lost in the fallen leaves

Every single move's uncertain
Don't tell God your plans
It's all deranged
No control

I should live my life on bended knee
If I can't control my destiny
You've gotta have a scheme
You've gotta have a plan
In the world of today, for tomorrow's man

No control

Stay away from the future
Don't tell God your plans
It's all deranged
No control

Forbidden words, deafen me
In memory,  no control
See how far a sinful man
Burns his tracks, his bloody robes
You've gotta have a scheme
You've gotta have a plan
In the world of today, for tomorrow's man

I should live my life on bended knee
If I can't control my destiny
No control I can't believe I've no control
It's all deranged

I can't believe I've no control
It's all deranged
Deranged
Deranged

Nothing To Be Desired

Oh! You Pretty Things



Wake up you sleepy head
Put on some clothes, shake up your bed
Put another log on the fire for me
I've made some breakfast and coffee
Look out my window and what do I see
A crack in the sky and a hand reaching down to me
All the nightmares came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay

What are we coming to
No room for me, no fun for you
I think about a world to come
Where the books were found by the Golden ones
Written in pain, written in awe
By a puzzled man who questioned
What we were here for
All the strangers came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay

Oh You Pretty Things
Don't you know you're driving your
Mamas and Papas insane
Oh You Pretty Things
Don't you know you're driving your
Mamas and Papas insane
Let me make it plain
You gotta make way for the Homo Superior

Look at your children
See their faces in golden rays
Don't kid yourself they belong to you
They're the start of a coming race
The earth is a bitch
We've finished our news
Homo Sapiens have outgrown their use
All the strangers came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay

Oh You Pretty Things
Don't you know you're driving your
Mamas and Papas insane
Oh You Pretty Things
Don't you know you're driving your
Mamas and Papas insane
Let me make it plain
You gotta make way for the Homo Superior

One Shot



Ooo-oo-oo-oh, oo-oo-oo-oh
Ooo-oo-oo-oh, oo-oo-ooo

The last days were the meanest
Leanest days of our lives
You threw me the pieces
I started the fire
One thing led to a dead end
One shot put her away, hey-hey

Look out on a green world
Windows and wives
No bedroom to run to
No miracle jive - no conversation

Then nothing meant nothing
Ten dollars tore us apart
One thing led to a dead end
One shot put her away

One day nothing meant nothing
Ten dollars tore us apart
One thing led to a dead end
One shot put her away

The last days were the meanest
Leanest days of our lives
One thing led to a dead end
One shot further away

Looked out on a green world
Windows and wives
No bedroom to run to
No miracle jive - no conversation

Hot love is the dearest
No money can buy
She burnt like a spitefire
One shot put her away

One shot put her away, heh-heh
One shot put her away, uh-huh-huh, uh-huh-huh
Oo-oo-oo-oh, uh-huh-huh, uh-huh-huh
Oo-oo-oo-oh, uh-huh-huh, uh-huh-huh
Oo-oo-oo-oh, uh-huh-huh, uh-huh-huh
Oo-oo-oo-oh, uh-huh-huh, uh-huh-huh
Oo-oo-oo-oh, uh-huh-huh
One shot put her away

Opening Titles Including Underground



It's only forever
Not long at all
Lost and lonely

No one can blame you
For walking away
Too much rejection
No love injection
Life can be easy
It's not always swell
Don't tell me truth hurts, little girl
'Cause it hurts like hell (echo hurts like hell)

But down in the underground
You'll find someone true
Down in the underground
A land serene
A crystal moon, ah ,ah

It's only forever
It's not long at all
Lost and lonely
That's underground

The crazed in the hot-zone
The mental and diva's hands
The fisting of life

Panic In Detroit



He looked a lot like Che Guevara, drove a diesel van
Kept his gun in quiet seclusion, such a humble man
The only survivor of the National People's Gang
Panic in Detroit, I asked for an autograph
He wanted to stay home, I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit

He laughed at accidental sirens that broke the evening gloom
The police had warned of repercussions
They followed none too soon
A trickle of strangers were all that were left alive
Panic in Detroit, I asked for an autograph
He wanted to stay home, I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit

Putting on some clothes I made my way to school
And I found my teacher crouching in his overalls
I screamed and ran to smash my favourite slot machine
And jumped the silent cars that slept at traffic lights

Having scored a trillion dollars, made a run back home
Found him slumped across the table.  A gun and me alone
I ran to the window.  Looked for a plane or two
Panic in Detroit.  He'd left me an autograph
"Let me collect dust."  I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit

Peace On Earth/Little Drummer Boy



DB: Hello... you're the new butler?
BC: Hahaha! Well, it's been a long time since I've been the new anything!
DB: What's happened to Hudson?
BC: I guess he's changing.
DB: Yeah, he does that a lot, doesn't he? Uhm... Oh, I'm David Bowie, I live
down the road.
BC: Oh!
DB: Sir Percival let's me use his piano if he not around. He's not around, is
he?
BC: I can honestly say I haven't seen him, but come on in! Come in!
DB: But uh...
BC: Come on in!
DB: Are you related to sir Percival?
BC: Well, distantly...
DB: Oh, you're not the poor relation from America, right?
BC: Ha! Gee... news sure travels fast, doesn't it? I'm Bing.
DB: Oh, I'm pleased to meet you. You're the one that sings, right?
BC: Well, right or wrong, I sing either way.
DB: Oh well, I sing too.
BC: Oh good! What kind of singing?
DB: Mostly the contemporary stuff. Do you eh... do you like modern music?
BC: Oh, I think it's marvellous! Some of it's really fine. But tell me, have you ever listened to any of the older fellows?
DB: Oh yeah, sure. I like ah... John Lennon and the other one with eh...Harry Nilsson.
BC: Mmm... you go back that far, uh?
DB: Yeah, I'm not as young as I look.
BC: Haha, none of us is these days!
DB: In fact I've got a six year old son. And he really gets excited around the Christmas holiday-thing.
BC: Do you go in for anything of the traditional things in the... boy, household, Christmas time?
DB: Oh yeah, most of them really. Presents, tree, decorations, agents sliding down the chimney...
BC: What??
DB: Oh, I was just seeing if you were paying attention.
BC: Haha!
DB: Actually, our family do most of the things that other families do. We
sing the same songs.
BC: Do you?
DB: Oh, I even have a go at 'White Christmas'.
BC: You do, eh!
DB: And this one. This is my son's favourite. Do you know this one?
BC: Oh, I do indeed, it's a lovely theme.

And they told me pa-ram-pam-pam-pam
A new-born king to see pa-ram-pam-pam-pam
Our finest gifts we bring pa-ram-pam-pam-pam
Ra-pam-pam-pam, ra-pam-pam-pam

Peace on Earth, can it be
Years from now, perhaps we'll see
See the day of glory
See the day, when men of good will
Live in peace, live in peace again

Peace on Earth, can it be

Every child must be made aware
Every child must be made to care
Care enough for his fellow man
To give all the love that he can

I pray my wish will come true
For my child and your child too
He'll see the day of glory
See the day when men of good will
Live in peace, live in peace again

Peace on Earth, can it be
Can it be

BC: It's a pretty theme, isn't it?

People From Bad Homes



People from bad homes
Don't have time
To look things over
Make up their minds
People from good homes
Don't have the minds
To care for bad homes
Don't have the time

Home is the mainland(?)
Can't take the blame
'Cause people have notions
To play out this game
Just stand on your own line
Stand high above
'Cause people have caution
And trouble to love

Me, I've got no home
Just Main street and wine(?)
No-one to hustle
No-one to jive
Me and my prospects
Just having a ball
Having the best time
Or nothing at all

Home is the mainland(?)
Can't take the blame
'Cause people have notions
To play out this game
Just stand on your own line
Stand high above
'Cause people have caution
And trouble to love

Home is the mainland(?)
Can't take the blame
'Cause people have notions
To play out this game
Just stand on your own line
Stand high above
'Cause people have caution
And trouble to love

Play It Safe



Say Ta
Eisenhower saw the thing
oh
oh
He said this is sickening
oh
I swear I saw the very thing
oh
I saw it in America

Let's play safe
I never knew how
How to play safe
You told me how
How to play safe
A thousand times

I don't believe in fairies any more

Today I saw a very very thing
But that's another song
You're too simple minded
Let's play it safe

What do we have in common?
(it was a real thing)
Play it safe

What do we have in common?
Play it safe
I'll tell you something safe

I want to be a criminal
Play it safe
Oh I wanna be a criminal

I want to be a criminal
Play it safe
well it's that real thing inside a criminal mind

What do we have in common?
Play it safe
that keeps me goin' all the time

What do we have in common?
Play it safe
that very very thing I find so sublime

I want to be a criminal
Play it safe
and I wanna know

I wanna know

I want to be a criminal
Play it safe
and I wanna know

I wanna know
I wanna know

What do we have in common?
Play it safe
rockin' and reelin' like Al Capone

What do we have in common?
(slippin' and slidin' like ?Joey Gale?)
and I wanna know

I wanna be a criminal
(movin' and groovin' with a Sonny Sam)
Play it safe

I wanna be a criminal
(splish splash I was Jim Jones)
Play it safe

Please Mr. Gravedigger



There's a little churchyard just along the way
It used to be Lambeth's finest array
Of tombstones, epitaphs, wreaths, flowers all that jazz
Til the war came along and someone dropped a bomb on the lot

And in this little yard, there's a little old man
With a little shovel in his little bitty hand
He seems to spend all his days puffing fags and digging graves
He hates the reverend vicar and he lives all alone in his home

"Ah-choo, excuse me"

Please Mr. Gravedigger, don't feel ashamed
As you dig little holes for the dead and the maimed
Please Mr. Gravedigger, I couldn't care
If you found a golden locket full of some girl's hair
And you put it in your pocket

"God, it's pouring down"

Her mother doesn't know about your sentimental joy
She thinks it's down below with the rest of her toys
And Ma wouldn't understand, so I won't tell
So keep your golden locket all safely hid away in your pocket

Yes, Mr. GD, you see me every day
Standing in the same spot by a certain grave
Mary-Ann was only 10, full of life and oh so gay
And I was the wicked man who took her life away
Very selfish, Oh God

No, Mr. GD, you won't tell
And just to make sure that you keep it to yourself
I've started digging holes myself
And this one here's for you

"Lifted our girl, she apparently doesn't know of it
 Hello misses, thought she'd be a little girl
 Bloody obscene, catch pneumonia or something in this rain"

Pretty Pink Rose



Yeah, she's just been to Russia and they're dying their faces
There dying over there
A pretty pink rose
[That rock 'n' roll lady takes a space-ship ride
She's out of this world
A pretty pink rose]

And we're living for you, my love
We're living for you
And we're dying for you, my love
Pretty pink rose

She tore down Paris on the tail of Thom Paine
But the left wing's broken, the right's insane
A pretty pink rose
[Ah, have a nice day, it's a killer, turn a cheek
It's a Christian code
A pretty pink rose]

And we're living for you, my love
Yes we're living for you
And we're dying for you, my love
Pretty pink rose

Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh

She's the poor man's gold, she's the anarchist crucible
Flying in the face of the despot cannibal
Pretty pink rose
Never let it rain, never rain
On the heart of the pretty pink rose
Pretty pink rose

And we're living for you, my love
We're living for you
And we're dying for you, my love
Pretty pink rose

Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh

Get me through the pain, through the pain
Of the thorn of the pretty pink rose
Never let it rain, never rain, never rain
On the pretty pink rose

[Take me to the heart, to the heart, to the heart
Of the pretty pink rose]
Never let it rain, never rain, never rain
[Take me to the heart, to the heart, to the heart]

Never never let it rain, never rain
[Take me to the heart, to the heart, to the heart
Of the pretty pink rose]
Never let it rain on the heart of the
[Take me to the heart, to the heart, to the heart]
Never let, never let it rain, never rain on the heart

[Take me to the heart, to the heart, to the heart
Of the pretty pink rose]
[Take me to the heart, to the heart, to the heart]
Never let it rain, never let it rain, never rain

[Take me to the heart, to the heart, to the heart]

Pretty Thing



Think about the good things
Think about thte bad things
Think about a reason to see you tonight
Somethng getting hard when you rock it up
Something getting hot when you rock it up
Pretty little girl let your sweet thing sway
Never gonna treat you wrong
Tie you down pretend you're Madonna
Never gonna treat you wrong

Oh you pretty thing
Shake your pretty thng
Gimmee that pretty thing

Think about the love thing
Think about the sex thing
Think about you holding me, taking me down
Something getting hard when you rock it up
Something getting hot when you rock it up
Pretty little girl let your sweet thing sway
Never gonna do you wrong
Strip you down and take you to pieces
Always gonna love this song

Oh you pretty thing
Feel that pretty thing
Suck that pretty thing

Prisoner Of Love



Don't look back
Whatever it takes to save your life
I've believed I belonged to you for a long time
And my heart says no, no one but you

Like a rescue on a darkened street
Love walked into town
I was a victim of my own self-persecution
I'm a prisoner of love-but I'm coming up for air


  Now don't be fooled by fools who promise you
  The world and all that glitters more fool you

I'm such a hungry man that I beg you over and over and over and over
And I might take any highway to be there with you
Even the best men shiver in their beds
I'm loving you above everything I have
I'm a prisoner of love-just stay square

Like a sermon on a blues guitar
Love walked into town
I was drowning so slowly
One step in front of your shadow
I'm a prisoner of love but I'm coming up for air



I smell the sickness sown in this city
It drives me to hide you, yea, even deceive you
I'm so afraid for you  that
I'll break any thug that maps out your passage to ruin
Even the best men shiver in their beds
I'm loving you above everything I have
I'm a prisoner of love-just stay square

Queen Bitch



I'm up on the eleventh floor
And I'm watching the cruisers below
He's down on the street
And he's trying hard to pull sister Flo
Oh, my heart's in the basement
My weekend's at an all time low
'Cause she's hoping to score
So I can't see her letting him go
Walk out of her heart
Walk out of her mind

She's so swishy in her satin and tat
In her frock coat and bipperty-bopperty hat
Oh God, I could do better than that

She's an old-time ambassador
Of sweet talking, night walking games
And she's known in the darkest clubs
For pushing ahead of the dames
If she says she can do it
Then she can do it, she don't make false claims
But she's a Queen, and such are queens
That your laughter is sucked in their brains
Now she's leading him on
And she'll lay him right down
Yes she's leading him on
And she'll lay him right down
But it could have been me
Yes, it could have been me
Why didn't I say, why didn't I say, no, no, no

She's so swishy in her satin and tat
In her frock coat and bipperty-bopperty hat
Oh God, I could do better than that

So I lay down a while
And I look at my hotel wall
Oh the cot is so cold
It don't feel like no bed at all
Yeah I lay down a while
And I look at my hotel wall
But he's down on the street
So I throw both his bags down the hall
And I'm phoning a cab
'Cause my stomach feels small
There's a taste in my mouth
And it's no taste at all
It could have been me
Oh yeah, it could have been me
Why didn't I say, Why didn't I say, no, no, no

She's so swishy in her satin and tat
In her frock coat and bipperty-bopperty hat
Oh God, I could do better than that

Quicksand



I'm closer to the Golden Dawn
Immersed in Crowley's uniform
Of imagery
I'm living in a silent film
Portraying Himmler's sacred realm
Of dream reality
I'm frightened by the total goal
Drawing to the ragged hole
And I ain't got the power anymore
No I ain't got the power anymore

I'm the twisted name on Garbo's eyes
Living proof of Churchill's lies
I'm destiny
I'm torn between the light and dark
Where others see their targets
Divine symmetry
Should I kiss the viper's fang
Or herald loud the death of Man
I'm sinking in the quicksand of my thought
And I ain't got the power anymore

Don't believe in yourself
Don't deceive with belief
Knowledge comes with death's release

I'm not a prophet or a stone age man
Just a mortal with the potential of a superman
I'm living on
I'm tethered to the logic of Homo Sapien
Can't take my eyes from the great salvation
Of bullshit faith
If I don't explain what you ought to know
You can tell me all about it
On the next Bardo
I'm sinking in the quicksand of my thought
And I ain't got the power anymore

Don't believe in yourself
Don't deceive with belief
Knowledge comes with death's release

Ragazzo Solo, Ragazza Sola



La mia mente ha preso il volo
Un pensiero, uno solo
Io cammino mentre dorme la citta'

I suoi occhi nella notte
Fanali bianchi nella notte
Una voce che mi parla chi sara'?

Dimmi ragazzo solo dove vai,
Perche' tanto dolore?
Hai perduto senza dubbio un grande amore
Ma di amori e' tutta piena la citta',

No ragazza sola, no no no
Stavolta sei in errore
Non ho perso solamente un grande amore
Ieri sera ho perso tutto con lei.

Ma lei
I colori della vita
Dei cieli blu
Una come lei non la trovero' mai piu'

Ora ragazzo solo dove andrai
La notte e' un grande mare
Se ti serve la mia mano per nuotare
Grazie ma stasera io vorrei morire
Perche' sai negli occhi miei
C'e' un angelo, un angelo
Che ormai non vola piu' che ormai non vola piu'
Che ormai non vola piu'
C'e' lei
I colori della vita
Dei cieli blu
Una come lei non la trovero' mai piu'

Real Cool World



So far this love is delightful
The face of seduction was you
But I listened for each and every footstep
In this Real Cool World

Questioning saintlike and fantastic heroes
Feeling like lost little children in fabled lands
So I listen for each and every friendship
In this Real Cool World

Now there is you
In my Real Cool World

Starry-eyed life but somehow believing in nothing
You whisper sweet nothing but reading between your lines
I listen, color me doubtful
In this Real Cool World

Now there is you
In my Real Cool World
Mmm
Now there is you
In my Real Cool World

You came from nowhere
You came from nowhere
You held me you shook me
Hey

It's a Cool World
It's a Cool World

It's a Real Cool World
It's a Real Cool World
It's a Real Cool World
It's a Real Cool World

Now there is you
In my Real Cool World

Now there is you
In my Real Cool World

Now there is you
In my Real Cool World

Remembering Marie A. (Erinnerung An Die Marie A.)



It was a day in that blue month September
Silent beneath the plum trees' slender shade
I held her there
My love, so pale and silent
As if she were a dream that must not fade

Above us in the shining summer heaven
There was a cloud my eyes dwelled long upon
It was quite white and very high above us
Then I looked up
And found that it had gone

And since that day, so many moons in silence
Have swum across the sky and gone below
The plum trees surely have been chopped for firewood
And if you ask, how does that love seem now
I must admit, I really can't remember
And yet I know what you are trying to say
But what her face was like, I know no longer
I only know I kissed it on that day

As for the kiss, I long ago forgot it
But for the cloud that floated in the sky
I know that still and shall forever know it
It was quite white and moved in very high
It may be that the plum trees still are blooming
That woman's seventh child may now be there
And yet that cloud had only bloomed for minutes
When I looked up
It vanished on the air

Repetition



Johnny is a man
And he's bigger than you
But his overheads are high
And he looks straight through when you ask him how the kids are

He'll get home around seven
'Cause the chevy's real old
And he could have had a cadillac
If the school had taught him right
And he could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse
He could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse

And the food is on the table
But the food is cold
Don't hit her

"Can't you even cook?
What's the good of me working when you can't damn cook?"

Well Johnny is a man
And he's bigger than her
I guess the bruises won't show
If she wears long sleeves
But the space in her eyes shows through

And he could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse
He could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse
Shows through
Shows through
Shows through

Ricochet



Like weeds on a rockface waiting for the scythe
Ricochet - ricochet
The world is on a corner waiting for jobs
Ricochet - ricochet
Turn the holy pictures so they face the wall
And who can bear to be forgotten
And who can bear to be forgotten

March of flowers, march of dimes
These are the prisons, these are the crimes
Men wait for news while thousands are still asleep
Dreaming of tramlines factories pieces of machinery
Mine shafts things like that
March of flowers, march of dimes
These are the prisons, these are the crimes
Sound of thunder, sound of gold
Sound of the devil breaking parole
Ricochet - it's not the end of the world

Sound of thunder, sound of gold
Sound of the devil breaking parole
Ricochet - ricochet
These are the prisons  these are the crimes
Teaching life in a violent new way
Ricochet - ricochet
Turn the holy pictures so they face the wall
And who can bear to be forgotten
And who can bear to be forgotten

March of flowers, march of dimes
These are the prisons, these are the crimes
Early, before the sun, they struggle off to the gates
In their secret fearful places they see their lives
Unravelling before them
March of flowers - march of dimes
These are the prisons, these are the crimes
Sound of thunder, sound of gold
Sound of the devil breaking parole
Ricochet it's not the end of the world

But when they get home, damp eyed and weary
They smile and crush their children to their heaving chests
Making unfulfillable promises
For who can bear to be forgotten

I never thought we'd hit it off until today

 (x2)
  Right on mother
  You know the way I feel
  Now you know I'm living with my girl and it's real
  I never thought you'd dig it
  So sure you'd hit the roof
  And now you're telling me you understand
  That I'm a man

Ba ba ba ba bah, ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba bah

Goodnight Siobahn
I'll see you in the morning
Me and ma have got a good thing on
Cause she thinks it's grand
That I'm a man

Ba ba ba ba bah, ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba bah

Right on mother
You know the way I feel
Now you know I'm living with my girl and it's real

Ba ba ba ba bah, ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba bah (repeat ad lib)

Rock 'N' Roll Suicide



Time takes a cigarette, puts it in your mouth
You pull on your finger, then another finger, then your cigarette
The wall-to-wall is calling, it lingers, then you forget
Ohhh, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide

You're too old to lose it, too young to choose it
And the clocks waits so patiently on your song
You walk past a cafe but you don't eat when you've lived too long
Oh, no, no, no,  you're a rock 'n' roll suciide

Chev brakes are snarling as you stumble across the road
But the day breaks instead so you hurry home
Don't let the sun blast your shadow
Don't let the milk float ride your mind
You're so natural - religiously unkind

Oh no love! you're not alone
You're watching yourself but you're too unfair
You got your head all tangled up but if I could only make you care
Oh no love! you're not alone
No matter what or who you've been
No matter when or where you've seen
All the knives seem to lacerate your brain
I've had my share, I'll help you with the pain
You're not alone

Just turn on with me and you're not alone
Let's turn on with me and you're not alone
Let's turn on and be not alone
Gimme your hands cause you're wonderful
Gimme your hands cause you're wonderful
Oh gimme your hands.

Rock 'N' Roll With Me



You always were the one that knew
They sold us for the likes of you
I always wanted new surroundings
A room to rent while the lizards lay crying in the heat
Trying to remember who to meet
I would take a foxy kind of stand
While tens of thousands found me in demand

When you rock 'n' roll with me
No one else I'd rather be
Nobody here can do it for me
I'm in tears again
When you rock 'n' roll with me

Gentle hearts are counted down
The queue is out of sight and out of sounds
Me, I'm out of breath, but not quite doubting
I've found a door which lets me out!

When you rock 'n' roll with me
No one else I'd rather be
Nobody down here can do it for me
I'm in tears again
When you rock 'n' roll with me

Oooo-oo-oo-oo

Oh, when you rock 'n' roll with me,
There's no one else I'd rather be, oh
Nobody down here can do it for me
When you rock 'n' roll with me

When you rock 'n' roll, rock 'n' roll with me
No one else I'd rather, I'd rather be
Nobody down here can do it for me
I'm in tears, I'm in tears
When you rock 'n' roll with me

Rosalyn



Hey Rosalyn, tell me where you've been
Hey Rosalyn, tell me where you've been
All the night and all the day
Hide and seek's the game you play
Treat me as sure as sin

Oh Rosalyn, yeah Rosalyn

VERSE
  Hey Rosalyn, you're the girl for me
  Hey Rosalyn, you're the girl for me
  When I'm holding you so tight
  It's so hard to say goodnight
  It's you that I love now can't you see?


  Do you really love me, do you love me true
  Do you really love me Rosalyn?
  Yeah gotta know, yeah gotta know
  Yeah gotta know Rosalyn

VERSE



Yeah gotta know, yeah gotta know
Yeah gotta know Rosalyn
Rosalyn
Yeah Rosalyn, Rosalyn, Rosalyn, Rosalyn, ooh-yeah, ah

Round And Round



Well, the joint was rocking

  Going round 'n' round
  Yeah, reeling and a-rocking
  What a crazy sound
  Well, they never stopped rocking
  'Til the moon went down

Well it sounded so sweet
I had to take me a chance
I rose out of my seat
And had to dance
I started moving my feet
And clapping my hands

Yeah, we kept on rocking



About twelve o'clock
When the place was packed
The front doors were locked
I said the place was packed
When the police knocked
Those doors flew back

But kept on rocking



Yeah

About twelve o'clock
Around lock up time
Well, the doors were locked
Said the place was packed
When  the police knocked
Those doors flew back

But it kept on rocking



Yeah, it kept on rocking



Rubber Band



Rubber Band
There's a rubber band that plays tunes out of tune
In the library garden Sunday afternoon
While a little chappie waves a golden wand

Rubber Band
In 1910 I was so handsome and so strong
My moustache was stiffly waxed and one foot long
And I loved a girl while you played teatime tunes

Dear Rubber Band, you're playing my tune out of tune, oh

Rubber Band
Won't you play a haunting theme again to me
While I eat my scones and drink my cup of tea
The sun is warm but it's a lonely afternoon

Oh, play that theme

Rubber Band
How I wish that I could join your Rubber Band
We could play in lively parks throughout the land
And one Sunday afternoon, I'd find my love

Rubber Band,
In the '14-'18 war I went to sea
Thought my Sunday love was waiting home for me
And now she's married to the leader of the band, oh

(spoken)
Oh sob... I hope you break your baton

Run



Wish I were a sailor
Crossing an azure sea
Under leaden skies
Under your eyes

But I can't see too far
With these animal eyes
Can't hold my breath
Without your voice

An' I'm danger-prone
I'll be bound
I'll be fast as hell
Without your touch

An' I'll run run run run run
An' I'll run run run run run
Without your love

I'm a goldman
I'm a soaring tower
And it's cold in here
Without your love

Trouble in here-trouble out there
Mainline problems til you no longer care
Get a long-low life-it's duty bound
No hope-no life-no you-ah ha

And I run run run
Run run run
Without your love

I duck the shots-tilt the world
I talk myself crazy-shoot the breeze
Shout to live-shoot to kill
Double up in pain-I'm on my knees

Running Gun Blues



I count the corpses on my left, I find I'm not so tidy
So I better get away, better make it today
I've cut twenty-three down since Friday
But I can't control it, my face is drawn
My instinct still emotes it

I slash them cold, I kill them dead
I broke the gooks, I cracked their heads
I'll bomb them out from under the beds
But now I've got the running gun blues

It seems the peacefuls stopped the war
Left generals squashed and stifled
But I'll slip out again tonight
Cause they haven't taken back my rifle
For I promote oblivion
And I'll plug a few civilians

I'll slash them cold, I'll kill them dead
I'll break them gooks, I'll crack their heads
I'll slice them till they're running red
But now I've got the running gun blues

Sacrifice Yourself



Some days he feels so empty
Just a talking head
Married to a Klingon
Who could cream him in the press

God could detonate him
God's the one we pick to curse us
And 35 years pass him
Like an evening at the circus


  Don't sacrifice yourself
  Sacrifice yourself
  Surprise yourself
  Don't sacrifice yourself

There it is, the look, the winner you
Once talked of being
Give her one last kiss and
Dive right out the window screaming
No truth decent, It was summer from the waist down
She blew the troops right off your feet
She tells you she's God's grammy



Her, the only game in town, a queen of competence
Blind in front of mirrors, proving nothings says a lot
Wham bam thank you Charlie
Vanity is all
You wander lonely to the scene
A crawling up the walls



Saviour Machine



President Joe once had a dream
The world held his hand, gave their pledge
So he told them his scheme for a Saviour Machine

They called it the Prayer, its answer was law
Its logic stopped war, gave them food
How they adored till it cried in its boredom

'Please don't believe in me, please disagree with me
Life is too easy, a plague seems quite feasible now
or maybe a war, or I may kill you all

Don't let me stay, don't let me stay
My logic says burn so send me away
Your minds are too green, I despise all I've seen
You can't stake your lives on a Saviour Machine

I need you flying, and I'll show that dying
Is living beyond reason, sacred dimension of time
I perceive every sign, I can steal every mind

Don't let me stay, don't let me stay
My logic says burn so send me away
Your minds are too green, I despise all I've seen
You can't stake your lives on a Saviour Machine

Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps)



She had an horror of rooms she was tired you can't hide beat
When I looked in her eyes they were blue but nobody home
She could've been a killer if she didn't walk the way she do, and she do
She opened strange doors that we'd never close again

She began to wail jealousies scream
Waiting at the light know what I mean

 (twice)
  Scary monsters, super creeps
  Keep me running, running scared

She asked me to stay and I stole her room
She asked for my love and I gave her a dangerous mind
Now she's stupid in the street and she can't socialise
Well I love the little girl and I'll love her till the day she dies

She wails
Jimmy's guitar sound jealousies scream
Waiting at the light know what I mean

 (twice)

 (twice)

Oh oh woh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh

Scream Like A Baby



Well I wouldn't buy no merchandise
And I wouldn't go to war
And I mixed with other colours
But the nurse doesn't care
And I hide under blankets
Or did I run away
I really can't remember
Last time I saw the light of day

But I remember Sam 'cause he was like me


  Scream like a baby
  Sam was a gun
  And I never knew his last name
  And we never had no fun

Well they came down hard on the faggots
And they came down hard on the street
They came down harder on Sam
And they all knew he was beat
He was thrown into the wagon
Blindfolded, chains, and they stomped on us
And took away our clothes and things
And pumped us full of strange drugs
And oh I saw Sam falling
Spitting in their eyes
But now I lay me down to sleep
And now I close my eyes
Now I'm learning to be a part of soc-society



No athletic program, no discipline, no book
He just sat in the backseat swearing he'd seek revenge
But he jumped into the furnace
Singing old songs we loved

 (twice)

See Emily Play



Emily tries but misunderstands
She's often inclined to borrow somebody's dreams 'til tomorrow


  There is no other day
  Let's try it another way
  You'll lose your mind and play
  Free games for May
  See Emily play

Soon after dark Emily cries
Gazing at trees in sorrow hardly a sound 'til tomorrow



Put on a gown that touches the ground
Float on a river for ever and ever
Emily



Sell Me A Coat



La la la la la la, la la la la la la la

A winter's day, a bitter snowflake on my face
My summer girl takes little backward steps away
Jack Frost took her hand and left me, Jack Frost ain't so cool


  Sell me a coat with buttons of silver
  Sell me a coat that's red or gold
  Sell me a coat with little patch pockets
  Sell me a coat 'cause I feel cold

And when she smiles, the ice forgets to melt away
Not like before, her smile was warming yesterday
See the trees like silver candy, feel my icy hand



See my eyes, my window pane
See my tears like gentle rain
That's the memory of a summer day

 (twice)

La la la la la la (repeat)

Sense Of Doubt


No lyrics for Sense Of Doubt

Seven Years In Tibet



"Are you OK?
You've been shot in the head
And I'm holding your brains"
The old woman said
So I drink in the shadows
Of an evening sky
See nothing at all

The stars look so special
And the snow looks so old
The frail form is drifting
Beyond the orchid? zone
Turn to question the mountain
Why pigs can fly
It's nothing at all

I praise to you
Nothing ever goes away
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes
I praise to you

I praise to you
Nothing ever goes away
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes away
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes, nothing ever goes
Nothing

Sex And The Church



Though the idea of ?convulsion? is said to be
The union of christ and his bride
The christian
It's all very puzzling

Sex and the church
Sex and the church
Sex and the church
And the church...and the church

All the great mystic religions
Put strong emphasis, on
The redeeming spiritual qualities
Of sex...of sex
Christianity
Has been pretty modern
About sex

Of sex
Of sex
Of sex
Of sex
Sex and the church
Sex and the church
Sex and the church
Sex...sex

I think there is a union
Between the flesh and the spirit
Sex and the church
Sex and the church

All religions' mother (spoken)

VERSE (twice)
  Give me the freedom of spirit
  And the joys of the flesh
  And sex...sex...
  Sex and the church

 (twice)
  Sex and the church

  And the church...and the church

Shades



You gave me a present
The paper was blue and green
I unwrapped it with pleasure
These are the best shades I've ever seen
You can be my girlfriend
Forever and a day
I never thought I was worth much
Or that anyone would treat me this way

I'm not
The kind of guy
Who dresses like a king
And a really fine pair of shades
Means everything
And the light that blinds my eyes
Shines from you

It makes me come in the night
It makes me swim with delight
I like this pain
I like this mirror
I like these shades

I could have had a problem
I might have never followed through
The other guys are in trouble
They wouldn't listen to a girl like you
These shades say something
I'll bet they cost a lot
I hope I don't break 'em
I hope we don't break up

I'm not
The kind of guy
Who dresses like a king
And a really fine pair of shades
Means everything
And the light that blinds my eyes
Shines from you

It makes me come in the night
It makes me swim with delight
I like this pain
I like this mirror
I like these shades

I like these shades
I like these shades

Shake It



I feel like a sail-boat
Adrift on the sea
It's a brand new day
So when you gonna phone me

I could take you to heaven
I could spin you to hell
But I'll take you to New York
It's the place that I know well

Sitting on a flagstone talking to a faceless girl
Wondering what to say but my eyes do the talking so well

I duck and I sway - what's my line
Shoot at a full moon - what's my line
What's my line - shake it baby

Cause love is the answer
Love's talking to me
I'd scream and I'll fight for you
You're better than money

We're the kind of people who can shake it if we're feeling blue
When I'm feeling disconnected well I sure know what to do
Shake it baby

Shapes Of Things



Shapes of things before my eyes
Just teach me to despise
Will time make man more wise
Here within my lonely frame
My eyes just hurt my brain
But will it seem the same


  (Come tomorrow), will I be older
  (Come tomorrow), maybe a soldier
  (Come tomorrow), may I be bolder than today

Now the trees are almost green
But will they still be seen
When time and tide have been
Boy into your passing hands
Please don't destroy these lands
Don't make them desert sands



Soon I hope that I will find
A seed within my mind
That won't disgrace my kind

She Shook Me Cold



We met upon a hill, the night was cool and still
She sucked my dormant will
Mother, she blew my brain, I will go back again
My God, she shook my cold

I had no time to spare, I grabbed her golden hair
And threw her to the ground
Father, she craved my head, Oh Lord, the things she said
My God, she should be told

I was very smart, broke the gentle hearts
Of many young virgins
I was quick on the ball, left them so lonely
They'd just give up trying
Then she took my head, smashed it up
Kept my young blood rising
Crushed me mercilessly, kept me going around
So she didn't know I crave her so-o-o

I'll give my love in vain, to reach that peak again
We met upon a hill
Mother, she blew my brain, I will go back again
My God, she shook me cold


She's Got Medals



She'd walk through the door and she'd set up the drinks on the house
She played a good game of darts, and the men slapped her back
And never took her out
She wore a trenchcoat khaki
Her hobnail boots were full of holes
  She's got medals

Her mother called her Mary, but she changed her name to Tommy, she's a one, oh
She went and joined the army, passed the medical
Don't ask me how it's done
They sent her to the front line
Fighting for her country's name
  She's got medals

She got very tired of picking up girls
Cleaning her gun and shaving her curls
Then the enemy dropped a bomb
Survivors there were none

People say that when the moon is full and all the stars have gone to bed
You can see her ghost but that's a lie because the naughty woman isn't dead
She deserted on the previous morning
Replaced her uniform with dresses silk and green
Called herself Eileen
Came to London town
Now she's settled down
  She's got medals

Shining Star (Makin' My Love)



Eddie boy lit like paraffin spending two weeks in a crack house
Burns on his brain like Chernobyl

Dean was seen with a two bag purchase
He was lying dead on his mother's bed
Someone for pray for-till I met you

Life is like a broken arrow-memory a swingin' door
I could be your great misfortune-
I can make you happy every day of your life
Making my love like a shining star-takin' my love just a touch too far

Tessie turns tricks with a soul like ice cause love left holes
And four swell kids breaking her heart
I've got windows, I've seen much vice, I've touched down with vermin,
Cowardice, lice,
And I say

Nobody cares what you do-please be yourself to death
I could be your great misfortune
But you'll never find a, bet you'll never find a better man.
Making my love like a shining star
Taking my love just a touch too far.

Peter met Frank formed a dummy run gang
Worked heist or hit for 10 g's flat
Blew heads outta shape for the name of Trotsky,
Sinn-Fein, Hitler cashdown
No hope heroes cover the page with depts in hell
And fingers in blood
Poor little bodies all covered in scabs threw it all away
Another life in the grave
Another life in the grave

Life is like a broken arrow-memory a swingin' door
I could be your great misfortune-
Well I could make you happy every goddamn single day of your life

Making my love like a shining star
Like a shining star
Baby that's what you are
Like a shining star

Making my love like a shining star
Taking my love
Just a touch too far

Shopping For Girls



Between the dead ring ash of extreme defense
The lonely groups of company boys
Snapping pictures of scrawny limbs and toothy grins
These are children riding naked on their tourist pals
While the hollows that pass for eyes swell from withdrawal
And he lies on a mattress in a rat infested room
Talking 'bout his family and the cold back home


  Between the dull cold eyes and the mind unstable
  Noone over here reads the papers pal
  'Tween the dull cold eyes and the mind unstable
  He's a clean trick and he's shopping for girls

A small black someone jumps over the crazy white guard
Cranking up the volume of a Michael Jackson song



Where the frangipani scents the air
She mouths a word that breaks his stare
He grunts his reply in a garrulous croak
"That's a mighty big word for a nine year old"



Shopping for girls, shopping for girls

You gaze down into her eyes for a million miles
You wanna give her a name and a clean rag doll

Silly Boy Blue



Mountains of Lhasa are feeling the rain
People are walking the Botella lanes
Preacher takes the school
One boy breaks a rule
Silly Boy Blue, silly Boy Blue

Yak butter statues that melt in the sun
Cannot dissolve all the work you've not done
A chela likes to feel
That his overself pays the bill
Silly Boy Blue, silly Boy Blue

You wish and wish, and wish again
You've tried so hard to fly
You'll never leave your body now
You've got to wait to die

La la la la la la la la la la (x2)
La la la la la (x2)
Silly Boy Blue, silly Boy Blue

Child of Tibet, you're a gift from the sun
Reincarnation of one better man
The homeward road is long
You've left your prayers and song
Silly Boy Blue, silly Boy Blue
Silly Boy Blue, silly Boy Blue.

Sister Midnight



Calling Sister Midnight
You've got me reaching for the moon
Calling Sister Midnight
You've got me playing the fool
Calling Sister Midnight

Calling Sister Midnight
Can you hear me call
Can you hear me well
Can you hear me at all
Calling Sister Midnight
I'm an Idiot for you
Calling Sister Midnight
I'm a breakage inside
Calling Sister Midnight
Calling Sister Midnight
You know I had a dream last night
Mother was in my bed
And I made love to her
Father he gunned for me
Hunted me with his six gun
Calling Sister Midnight
What can I do about my dreams

Listen to me Sister Midnight
You put a beggar in my heart
Calling Sister Midnight
You've got me walking in rags
Hey where are you Sister Midnight
Can you hear me call
Can you hear me well
Can you hear me at all

  Senna colour brazing glass
  Some are bound to fail
  Some are winter sun, ahhh

Some Weird Sin



I never got my
License to live
They won't give it up
So I stand at the world's edge
I'm trying to break in
Oh I know it's not for me
And the sight of it all
Makes me sad and ill
That's when I want
Some weird sin

Things get too straight
I can't bear it
I feel stuck
Stuck on a pin
I'm trying to break in
Oh I know it's not for me
And the sight of it all
Makes me sad and ill
That's when I want
Some weird sin
That's when I want
Some weird sin
Just to relax with
Yeah, some dumb weird sin
For a while anyway
With my head on the ledge
That's what you get
Out on the edge
Some weird sin

Things get too straight
I can't bear it
I feel stuck
Stuck on a pin
I'm trying to break in
Oh I know it's not for me
And the sight of it all
Makes me sad and ill
That's when I want
Some weird sin
That's when I want
Some weird sin
Just to relax with
Yeah, some dumb weird sin
For a while anyway
With my head on the ledge
That's what you get
Out on the edge
Some weird sin
Some weird sin
Some weird sin

Somebody Up There Likes Me



Let the lies go
Let...

He's everybody's token, on everybody's wall
Blessing all the papers, thanking one and all
Hugging all the babies, kissing all the ladies
Knowing all that you think about from writing on the wall

 1
  He's so divine, his soul shines
  Breaks the night, sleep tight
  His ever loving face smiles on the whole human race
  He says "I'm somebody"

 2
  He's got his eye on your soul, his hand on your heart
  He says "Don't hurry, baby
  Somebody up there (somebody) likes me"

He's the savage son of the TV tube
Planets wrote the day was due
All the wisest men around
Predicted that a man was found
Who looked a lot like you and me, yeah
Everyone with sense could see
Nothing left his eye unmoved, he
Had the plan, he had to use

 1 and 2

Somebody plays my song in tune
Makes me, makes me, makes me stronger for you, babe
Was a way when we were young, that
Any man was judged by what he'd done
But now you pick them on the screen (what they look like)
Where they've been

 2

Leaders come, they hate all
The people know
That given time, the leaders go
Tell me, can they hold you under their spell
Can they walk and hold you as well as a
Smile like Valentino?
Could he sell you anything?

Keep your eyes on your soul, keep your hand on your heart
He says "Don't hurry, baby
Somebody up there (somebody) likes me"

  (somebody, somebody, somebody)
  (somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody)
Somebody (somebody) somebody (somebody) somebody (somebody, somebody)
Somebody (somebody) somebody (somebody) somebody (somebody, somebody)
Yeah, can't remember (somebody) peace so well
Oh, space to ramble, (somebody, somebody) space to boogie

Soul shine (Ooh-ooh)
So divine
Somebody (ooh-ooh, somebody)

Soul shine (Ooh-ooh)
So divine
Somebody (ooh-ooh)

Somebody, somebody, somebody

Song For Bob Dylan



Oh, hear this Robert Zimmerman
I wrote a song for you
About a strange young man called Dylan
With a voice like sand and glue
His words of truthful vengeance
They could pin us to the floor
Brought a few more people on
And put the fear in a whole lot more

Ah, Here she comes
Here she comes
Here she comes again
The same old painted lady
From the brow of a superbrain
She'll scratch this world to pieces
As she comes on like a friend
But a couple of songs
From your old scrapbook
Could send her home again

You gave your heart to every bedsit room
At least a picture on my wall
And you sat behind a million pair of eyes
And told them how they saw
Then we lost your train of thought
The paintings are all your own
While troubles are rising
We'd rather be scared
Together than alone

Ah, Here she comes
Here she comes
Here she comes again
The same old painted lady
From the brow of a superbrain
She'll scratch this world to pieces
As she comes on like a friend
But a couple of songs
From your old scrapbook
Could send her home again

Now hear this Robert Zimmerman
Though I don't suppose we'll meet
Ask your good friend Dylan
If he'd gaze a while down the old street
Tell him we've lost his poems
So they're writing on the walls
Give us back our unity
Give us back our family
You're every nation's refugee
Don't leave us with their sanity

Ah, Here she comes
Here she comes
Here she comes again
The same old painted lady
From the brow of a superbrain
She'll scratch this world to pieces
As she comes on like a friend
But a couple of songs
From your old scrapbook
Could send her home again

A couple of songs
From your old scrapbook
Could send her home again
Oh, here she comes, here she comes
Oh, here she comes, here she comes

Sons Of The Silent Age



Sons of the silent age
Stand on platforms blank looks and note books
Sit in back rows of city limits
Lay in bed coming and going on easy terms
Sons of the silent age
Pace their rooms like a cell's dimensions
Rise for a year or two then make war
Search through their one inch thoughts
Then decide it couldn't be done

Baby, I'll never let you go
All I see is all I know
Let's find another way down (sons of sound and sons of sound)
Baby, baby, I'll never let you down
I can't stand another sound
Let's take another way in (sons of sound and sons of sound)

Sons of the silent age
Listen to tracks by Sam Therapy and King Dice
Sons of the silent age
Pick up in bars and cry only once
Sons of the silent age
Make love only once but dream and dream
They don't walk, they just glide in and out of life
They never die, they just go to sleep one day

Baby, I won't ever let you go
All I see is all I know
Let's take another way down (sons of sound and sons of sound)
Oh baby, baby, baby, I won't ever let you down
I can't stand another sound
Let's find another way in (sons of sound and sons of sound)
(Sons of sound and sons of sound)
Baby, baby, baby, fire away!

Sorrow



With your long blonde hair and your eyes of blue
The only thing I ever got from you was sorrow
Sorrow
You acted funny trying to spend my money
You're out there playing your high class games of sorrow
Sorrow

You never do what you know you oughta
Something tells me you're a Devil's daughter
Sorrow, sorrow
Ahhhh, ah, ahhhh

I tried to find her
'Cause I can't resist her (I tried to find her)
I never knew just how much I missed her
Sorrow
Sorrow

With your long blonde hair and your eyes of blue
The only thing I ever got from you was sorrow
Sorrow
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

With your long blonde hair
I couldn't sleep last night
With your long blonde hair

Sorry



Time is tight love always gets in the way
I'm sorry

Didn't mean to hurt you but I always do
I'm sorry
I'm so sorry

I'm so sorry
I'm sorry
You know I am

Well my eyes are pinned and my money's spent
I'm sorry
You know I'm sorry
I wouldn't do for me what I would for for you
Would you forgive me
I'm sorry
I'm so sorry

I guess I've thrown it away
I've thrown it away
Didn't mean to do it that way
I'm sorry
Time is so tight
And I mean it if I say
I'm so sorry
I didn't mean to hurt you
I'm sorry

I'm sorry
I'm sor-rrr-ry
You know I am

Soul Love



Stone love - she kneels before the grave
A brave son - who gave his life to see the slogan
That hovers between the headstone and her eyes
For they penetrate her grieving

New love - a boy and girl are talking
New words - that only they can share in
New words - a love so strong it tears their hearts
To sleep - through the fleeting hours of morning
Love is careless in its choosing - sweeping over cross a baby
Love descends on those defenseless
Idiot love will spark the fusion
Inspirations have I none - just to touch the flaming dove
All I have is my love of love - and love is not loving

Soul love - the priest that tastes the word and
Told of love - and how my God on high is
All love - though reaching up my loneliness evolves
By the blindness that surrounds him

Love is careless in its choosing - sweeping over cross a baby
Love descends on those defenseless
Idiot love will spark the fusion
Inspirations have I none - just to touch the flaming dove
All I have is my love of love - and love is not loving

Sound And Vision



Ahhh...
Ahhh...

Doo, doo, doo, do-doh
Doo, doo, doo, do-doh

Don't you wonder sometimes
'Bout sound and vision

Blue, blue, electric blue
That's the colour of my room
Where I will live
Blue, blue

Pale blinds drawn all day
Nothing to do, nothing to say
Blue, blue

I will sit right down, waiting for the gift of sound and vision
And I will sing, waiting for the gift of sound and vision
Drifting into my solitude, over my head

Don't you wonder sometimes
'Bout sound and vision

Space Oddity



Ground Control to Major Tom
Ground Control to Major Tom
Take your protein pills and put your helmet on

Ground Control to Major Tom
Commencing countdown, engines on
Check ignition and may God's love be with you

(spoken)
Ten, Nine, Eight, Seven, Six, Five, Four, Three, Two, One, Liftoff

This is Ground Control to Major Tom
You've really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare

    "This is Major Tom to Ground Control
     I'm stepping through the door
     And I'm floating in a most peculiar way
     And the stars look very different today

     For here
     Am I sitting in a tin can
     Far above the world
     Planet Earth is blue
     And there's nothing I can do

     Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles
     I'm feeling very still
     And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
     Tell my wife I love her very much she knows"

Ground Control to Major Tom
Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you....

    "Here am I floating round my tin can
     Far above the Moon
     Planet Earth is blue
     And there's nothing I can do."

Star



Tony went to fight in Belfast
Rudi stayed at home to starve
I could make it all worthwhile as a rock & roll star
Bevan tried to change the nation
Sonny wants to turn the world, well he can tell you that he tried

 (x2)
  I could make a transformation as a rock & roll star
  So inviting - so enticing to play the part
  I could play the wild mutation as a rock & roll star
   (second time: Get it all yeah!)
  I could do with the money
  I'm so wiped out with things as they are
  I'd send my photograph to my honey - and I'd c'mon like a regular superstar

I could fall asleep at night as a rock & roll star
I could fall in love all right as a rock & roll star

Starman



Didn't know what time it was and the lights were low
I leaned back on my radio
Some cat was layin' down some rock 'n' roll 'lotta soul, he said
Then the loud sound did seem to fade
Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase
That weren't no D.J. that was hazy cosmic jive

()
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me:
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie

I had to phone someone so I picked on you
Hey, that's far out so you heard him too!
Switch on the TV we may pick him up on channel two
Look out your window I can see his light
If we can sparkle he may land tonight
Don't tell your poppa or he'll get us locked up in fright

 (x2)

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la (repeat)

Stateside



I'm going home
I've been gone much too long
She said she missed me
Since I been gone
I'll be back soon
Ain't no doubt
'Cause she said she wanted my loving, my loving

 (twice)
  No holding back I'm going home
  No holding back I'm going home
  I'm going stateside with my convictions

I said I'm coming home soon
I don't know when
It will be sometime soon
Sooner than
I thought I'd be
I thought I'd be
I thought I'd be stateside sooner than later

Marilyn inflatables home on the range
Where the living is easy on a horse with no name
Kennedy convertibles home on the range
Where the suffering comes easy on a blonde with no brain
I'm going stateside
I'm going stateside

I'm going home
It's been so long
She said she missed me
And all the fun we've had
I think it be the best way
She said she missed me in
Every, every way, so

 (twice)

I've been gone so long
I've been gone, I've been gone
I'm missing you

Marilyn inflatables home on the range
Where the living is easy on a horse with no name
Kennedy convertibles home on the range
Where the suffering comes easy on a ten dollar raise
I'm going stateside
I'm going stateside

Station To Station



The return of the Thin White Duke
Throwing darts in lovers' eyes
Here are we, one magical moment, such is the stuff
From where dreams are woven
Bending sound, dredging the ocean, lost in my circle
Here am I, flashing no colour
Tall in this room overlooking the ocean

Here are we, one magical movement from Kether to Malkuth *
There are you, you drive like a demon from station to station
The return of the Thin White Duke, throwing darts in lovers' eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke, throwing darts in lovers' eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke, making sure white stays

Once there were mountains on mountains
And once there were sunbirds to soar with
And once I could never be down
Ggot to keep searching and searching
Oh, what will I be believing and who will connect me with love?
Wonder *who*, wonder who, wonder when
Have you sought fortune, evasive and shy?
Drink to the men who protect you and I
Drink, drink, drain your glass, raise your glass high

TWO TIMES:
  It's not the side-effects of the cocaine
  I'm thinking that it must be love
  It's too late - to be grateful
  It's too late - to be late again
  It's too late - to be hateful
  The european cannon is here

  I must be only one in a million
  I won't let the day pass without her
  It's too late - to be grateful
  It's too late - to be late again
  It's too late - to be hateful
  The european cannon is here

  Should I believe that I've been stricken?
  Does my face show some kind of glow?
  It's too late - to be grateful
  It's too late - to be late again
  It's too late - to be hateful
  The european cannon is here, yes it's here
  It's too late

  It's too late, it's too late, it's too late, it's too late
  The european cannon is here

Stay



This week dragged past me so slowly
The days fell on their knees
Maybe I'll take something to help me
Hope someone takes after me
I guess there's always some change in the weather
This time I know we could get it together
If I did casually mention tonight
That would be crazy tonight

Stay - that's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is stay this time
I really meant to so bad this time
'cause you can never really tell when somebody
Wants something you want too

Heartwrecker, heartwrecker, make me delight
Right is so vague when it brings someone new
This time tomorrow I'll know what to do
I know it's happened to you

Stay - that's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is stay this time
I really meant to so bad this time

'cause you can never really tell when somebody
Wants something or wants to stay
That's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is stay this time
I really meant to so bad this time
'cause you can never really tell when somebody
Wants something you want too

Strangers When We Meet



Yooou, yooou, yooou
Yooou, yooou, yooou

All our friends
Now seem so thin and frail
Slinky secrets
Hotter than the sun

No peachy prayers
No trendy rechauffé
I'm with you
So I can't go on


  All my violence
  Raining tears upon the sheet
  I'm bewildered/resentful
  For we're strangers when we meet

Blank screen TV
Preening ourselves in the snow
Forget my name
But I'm over you

Blended sunrise
And it's a dying world
Humming Rheingold
We scavenge up our clothes



Cold tired fingers
Tapping out your memories
Halfway sadness
Dazzled by the new

Your embrace
Was all that I feared
That whirling room
We trade by vendu

Steely resolve
Is falling from me
My poor soul
All bruised passivity
All your regrets
Ride rough-shod over me
I'm so glad
That we're strangers when we meet
I'm so thankful
That we're strangers when we meet
I'm in clover
For we're strangers when we meet
Heel head over
But we're strangers when we meet

Strangers when we meet (repeat ad. inf.)

Subterraneans



Share bright failing star
Care-line, care-line, care-line, care-line
Riding these shelly, shelly, shelly umm

This mellow thighed chick just put my spine out of place

Sweet Head



I tried to break away from you
From the spics and blacks and the gum you chew
Where the posters are torn by the muggin' gangs
By the faggy parks and the burnt out vans
I've got ninety-nine years of laying in the dark and I'm far too young to lie
I've got ninety-nine ways to play my guitar it's going to pay me before I die


  So bob your sweet head
  Brother Ziggy going to play
  I'm just about the best you can hear
  Gonna rock it in your head
  Shazam! and come ball
  With my guitar and Mr. ?Final?
  We can give you sweet head

I'm tough as glass and clean as night
Well if looks can love we can love all right
I'm your rubber peacock angelic whore
I'm a wrought iron face upon the wall
I had ninety-nine years of murder-come-life and I'm running away from it all
I got a bedroom, every mirror in town they're going to claim me if I fall



Sweet head, give you sweet head
(spoken: while ya down there)

See my eyes of blocked emotion, see my tremble, see my fall
Traumatics thick and fast, your faith in me can last
Besides I'm known to lay you, one and all

Look south the way your mother dwells
If she knew what's going down, she'd give you hell
I'm the kind of man she warned me of
Till there was rock, you only had god

You and I have a mutual vow
We both like young, and we both like loud
I got pretty shoes, and I'm kid and proud
I'm street side out with my ear to the crowd



Move along, sir!

Sweet Thing



It's safe in the city, to love in a doorway
To wrangle some screens from the door
And isn't it me, putting pain in a stranger?
Like a portrait in flesh, who trails on a leash
Will you see that I'm scared and I'm lonely?
So I'll break up my room, and yawn and I
Run to the centre of things
Where the knowing one says


  Boys, boys, its a sweet thing
  Boys, boys, its a sweet thing, sweet thing
  If you want it, boys, get it here, thing
  'Cause hope, boys, is a cheap thing, cheap thing

I'm glad that you're older than me
Makes me feel important and free
Does that make you smile, isn't that me?
I'm in your way, and I'll steal every moment
If his trade is a curse, then I'll bless you
And turn to the crossroads, and hamburgers, and



Sweet Thing (reprise)



If you want it, boys, get it here thing
'Cause hope, boys, is a cheap thing, cheap thing

Is it nice in your snow storm, freezing your brain?
Do you think that your face looks the same?
Then let it be, it's all I ever wanted
It's a street with a deal, and a taste
It's got claws, it's got me, it's got you

I give my complete attention to a very good friend of mine
He's quadraphonic, he's a, he's got more channels
So hologramic, oh my T V C one five
I brought my baby home, she, she sat around forlorn
She saw my T V C one five, baby's gone, she
She crawled right in, oh my
She crawled right in my
So hologramic, oh my T V C one five
Oh, so demonic, oh my T V C one five

VERSE
  Maybe if I pray every, each night I sit there pleading
  "Send back my dream test baby, she's my main feature"
  My T V C one five, he, he just stares back unblinking
  So hologramic, oh my T V C one five
  One of these nights I may just
  Jump down that rainbow way. be with my baby, then
  We'll spend some time together
  So hologramic, oh my T V C one five
  My baby's in there someplace, love's rating in the sky
  So hologramic, oh my T V C one five

Take My Tip



You think you're gonna please her
So you walk right up and tease her
But she walks right on by
You're scared to walk beside her
'Cause you're playing with the spider who possess the sky
She got the green backs, my-oh-my
You gotta act tall, think big, if you wanna make a mark in her book
Gotta get ahead, get a car, fancy clothes
Or she'll throw you right off her hook
Here's the news- you are but one fish in her back garden scene
Gonna make like a shark to be free
Something bad on your mind
Take my tip- get on out
Take my tip- get on out

You can't give all you got to take something back
Before she'll put you right up on her rack
With some others in mind

But she walks right on by

You gotta act tall, think big, if you wanna make a mark in her book
Gotta get ahead, get a car, fancy clothes
Or she'll throw you right off her hook
Here's the news- you are but one fish in her back garden scene
Gonna make like a shark to be free

Teenage Wildlife



Well, how come you only want tomorrow
With its promise of something hard to do
A real life adventure worth more than pieces of gold
Blue skies above and sun on your arms strength in your stride
And hope in those squeaky clean eyes
You'll get chilly receptions everywhere you go
Blinded with desire - guess the season is on

So you train by shadow boxing, search for the truth
But it's all, but it's all used up
Break open your million dollar weapon
And push your luck, still you push, still you push your luck
A broken nosed mogul are you
One of the new wave boys

Same old thing in brand new drag
Comes sweeping into view, oh-ooh
As ugly as a teenage millionaire
Pretending it's a whizz kid world
You'll take me aside, and say
"Well, David, what shall I do?
They wait for me in the hallway"
I'll say "Don't ask me, I don't know any hallways"
But they move in numbers and they've got me in a corner
I feel like a group of one, no-no
They can't do this to me
I'm not some piece of teenage wildlife

Those midwives to history put on their bloody robes
The word is that the hunted one is out there on his own
You're alone for maybe the last time
And you breathe for a long time
Then you howl like a wolf in a trap
And you daren't look behind

You fall to the ground like a leaf from the tree
And look up one time at that vast blue sky
Scream out aloud as they shoot you down
No no, I'm not a piece of teenage wildlife
I'm not a piece of teenage wildlife

And no one will have seen and no one will confess
The fingerprints will prove that you coudn't pass the test
There'll be others on the line filing past, who'll whisper low
I miss you he really had to go
Well each to his own, he was
Another piece of teenage wildlife, oh-oh-oh-ohh
Another piece of teenage wildlife, oh-oh-oh-ohh
Another piece of teenage wild...
Wild
Wild
Wild

Telling Lies



Gorgeous girls are bound to meet
To talk of stars and kings and feet
Through the chromosomes of space and time
Me I'm fast like bad infection
Gasping for my resurrection
Swear to me in times of war and stress


  Telling lies, telling lies
  Telling lies, telling lies
  Telling lies
    [Ooh, ah, visionary]
    [Ooh, ah, missionary]
  Telling lies
    [Feels like something's gonna happen this year]
  Telling lies
    [Ooh, ah, visionary]
    [Ooh, ah, missionary]
  Telling lies
    [Feels like something's gonna happen this year]
  Telling lies

Shadow falls in shrinking smiles
See me poised at the happy games
Standing in the mouth of all that's pure
Come straggling in your tattered remnants
You'll come to me in tears and rain
I'm your future, I'm tomorrow, I'm the end



Telling lies
 [Ooh, ah, ooh]
 [Ooh, ah, ooh]
 [Ooh, ah, ooh]
Feels like something's going to happen this year
Telling lies [ooh, ah, ooh]
Feels like something's going to happen this year
Telling lies [ooh, ah, ooh]
Feels like something's going to happen this year
Telling lies [ooh, ah, ooh]
Telling lies [ooh, ah, ooh]
Feels like something's going to happen this year

That's Motivation



Do you hear what I hear?
Do you see what I see?
Colin, I want you to use your imagination
You wake up one morning and you ask yourself:

Why it is so exciting?
What makes me dramatic?
You're trying to say something about yourself
The dazzling crime of wisdom

You fall for reality
You're bruised and bewildered
Then you learn to fall in love with yourself
That's motivation

You raise yourself high
Presenting your soul
You step from the shadows
You hear the command
An image to dream
You tremble permission
Tomorrow's rewards bloody skies of today
You'll step out of time
Into life's every dream
A life of such powerful meaning

Now you have class
Now you have splash
Now you have mass motivation

Here's an image I recommend
Here's a product you will die for
Here's a nightmare that will never end
??

You know you got something
You know you got style
We don't take much just a little bit
That's motivation

Welcome to the world of your dreams, Colin
Where you can be what you want
Commit horrible sins
And get away with it

Lust
Gluttony
Pride
Anger
Sloth
Avarice
And jealousy

You know you got something
You know you got the style
We don't take much, but a little bit
That's motivation

No more false illusion
Goodbye to confusion
Stand out from the madding crowd
Motivation is symphony

Symphony in style - [that's motivation]
It's brilliant, original - [that's motivation]
Stimulating, encouragement - [that's motivation]
As precious from home - [that's motivation]
So what - [motivation]
Say what - [motivation]
New - [moti...]
So - [moti...]

Now you have class motiv...
Now you have mass motivation

That's Where My Heart Is



I just cannot believe
That you want me
Beg at your door
I just cannot believe
That you want me
Forever more
Time and time I tried to make you mine
I didn't think it would be such a short time
Before you came my way

Up where the moon is shining so bright
That's where my heart is tonight
Up where the moon is so bright
That's where my heart is tonight

I thought my day would come
When I would be
The only one
I thought my day would come
Under the moon
And under the sun
Now I shout through all the streets today
Lucky me, your love has come my way
Now tell me I was a fool

Up where the moon is shining so brightly
That's where my heart is tonight
Up where the moon is so bright
That's where my heart is tonight

I believe that dreams come through
I believe, because of you
He who made the stars in the sky
Made the world for you and I

I just cannot believe
That you want me
Beg at your door
I just cannot believe
That you want me
Forever more
Time and time I tried to make you mine
I didn't think it would be such a short time
Before you came my way

Up where the moon is shining so bright
That's where my heart is tonight
Up where the moon is so bright
That's where my heart is tonight

The Bewlay Brothers



And so the story goes they wore the clothes
They said the things to make it seem improbable
The whale of a lie like they hope it was
And the Goodmen Tomorrow
Had their feet in the wallow
And their heads of Brawn were nicer shorn
And how they bought their positions with saccharin and trust
And the world was asleep to our latent fuss
Sighing, the swirl through the streets
Like the crust of the sun
The Bewlay Brothers
In our Wings that Bark
Flashing teeth of Brass
Standing tall in the dark
Oh, And we were Gone
Hanging out with your Dwarf Men
We were so turned on
By your lack of conclusions

I was Stone and he was Wax
So he could scream, and still relax, unbelievable
And we frightened the small children away
And our talk was old and dust would flow
Thru our veins and Lo! it was midnight
Back o' the kitchen door
Like the grim face on the Cathedral floor
And the solid book we wrote
Cannot be found today

And it was Stalking time for the Moonboys
The Bewlay Brothers
With our backs on the arch
In the Devil-may-be-here
But He can't sing about that
Oh, And we were Gone
Real Cool Traders
We were so Turned On
You thought we were Fakers

Now the dress is hung, the ticket pawned
The Factor Max that proved the fact
Is melted down
And woven on the edging of my pillow
Now my Brother lays upon the Rocks
He could be dead, He could be not
He could be You
He's Chameleon, Comedian, Corinthian and Caricature
"Shooting-up Pie-in-the-Sky"
The Bewlay Brothers
In the feeble and the Bad
The Bewlay Brothers
In the Blessed and Cold
In the Crutch-hungry Dark
Was where we flayed our Mark
Oh, and we were Gone
Kings of Oblivion
We were so Turned On
In the Mind-Warp Pavilion

Lay me place and bake me Pie
I'm starving for me Gravy
Leave my shoes, and door unlocked
I might just slip away

Just for the Day, Hey!
Please come Away, Hey! 

The Drowned Girl (Vom Ertrunkenen Madchen)



Once she had drowned and started her slow descent
Down the streams to where the great rivers broaden
Oh, the open sky chant most magnificent
As if it was acting as her body's guardian
Wreck and duck weed slowly increased her weight
By clasping her in their slimy grip
Through her limbs, the cold blooded fishes played
Creatures and plant life kept on, thus obstructing her last trip

And the sky that same evening grew dark as smoke
And its stars through the night kept the brightness still soaring
But it quickly grew clear when dawn now broke
To see that she got one further morning
Once her pallid trunk had rotted beyond repair
It happened quite slowly that she gently slipped from God's thoughts
First with her face, then her hands, right at the last with her hair
Leaving those corpse-choked rivers just one more corpse

The Gospel According to Tony Day



The Gospel according to Tony Day (x3)
If I find a girl he'll take her away
Rotten Tony!

The Gospel according to Brendan O'Lear (x3)
If I buy him a Scotch, he'll buy me a beer
Tight fist, friends

The Gospel according to Pat Hewitt (x3)
If it's written on a sweater then I'd better not, you do it
Ah
Got to, got to

Your mind, blow it
Blow it

The Gospel according to Marianne Brent (x3)
She'll be mine if I pay the rent
Good old Marianne, who needs friends, oh

That's the fucking time, take a look at my life and you'll see
Take a quick, butchers, rotten Mary down the oak
Wouldn't give me two pence for him

The Jean Genie



A small Jean Genie snuck off to the city
Strung out on lasers and slash back plazas
Ate all your razors while pulling the waiters
Talking bout Monroe and walking on Snow White
New York's a go-go and everything tastes right
Poor little Greenie

The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
He's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
Jean Genie let yourself go!

Sits like a man but he smiles like a reptile
She loves him, she loves him but just for a short while
She'll scratch in the sand, won't let go his hand
He says he's a beautician and sells you nutrition
And keeps all your dead hair for making up underwear
Poor little Greenie

The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
He's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
Jean Genie let yourself go!

He's so simple minded he can't drive his module
He bites on the neon and sleeps in the capsule
Loves to be loved, loves to be loved

The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
He's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
Jean Genie let yourself go!

The Laughing Gnome



I was walking down the High Street
When I heard footsteps behind me
And there was a little old man (Hello)
In scarlet and grey, shuffling away (laughter)
Well he trotted back to my house
And he sat beside the telly (Oaah..)
With his tiny hands on his tummy
Chuckling away, laughing all day (laughter)

Oh, I ought to report you to the Gnome office
(Gnome Office)
Yes
(Hahahahaha)


  Ha ha ha, hee hee hee
  "I'm a laughing Gnome and you don't catch me"
  Ha ha ha, hee hee hee
  "I'm a laughing Gnome and you can't catch me"
  Said the laughing Gnome

Well I gave him roasted toadstools and a glass of dandelion wine (Burp, pardon)
Then I put him on a train to Eastbourne
Carried his bag and gave him a fag
(Haven't you got a light boy?)
"Here, where do you come from?"
(Gnome-man's land, hahihihi)
"Oh, really?"

In the morning when I woke up
He was sitting on the edge of my bed
With his brother whose name was Fred
He'd bought him along to sing me a song

Right, let's hear it
Here, what's that clicking noise?
(That's Fred, he's a "metrognome", haha)

Ha ha ha, hee hee hee
"I'm a laughing Gnome and you don't catch me"
Ha ha ha, hee hee hee
"I'm a laughing Gnome and you can't catch me"

(Own up, I'm a gnome, ain't I right, haha)
"Haven't you got an 'ome to go to?"
(No, we're gnomads)
"Didn't they teach you to get your hair cut at school?
 you look like a rolling gnome."
(No, not at the London School of Ecognomics)

Now they're staying up the chimney
And we're living on caviar and honey (hooray!)
Cause they're earning me lots of money
Writing comedy prose for radio shows
It's the-er (what?)
It's the Gnome service of course

Ha ha ha, hee hee hee
"I'm a laughing Gnome and you don't catch me"
Ha ha ha, oh, dear me

(Ha ha ha, hee hee hee
"I'm a laughing Gnome and you can't catch me"
 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee
"I'm a laughing Gnome and you can't catch me")

(One more time, yeah)



The London Boys



Cow bell strikes another night
Your eyes are heavy and your limbs all ache
You've bought some coffee, butter and bread
You can't make a thing cause the meter's dead
You moved away
Hold your folks you're gonna stay away

Bright lights, Soho, Wardour street
You hope you make friends with the guys that you meet
Somebody shows you round
Now you've met the London boys
Things seem good again, someone cares about you

Oh, the first time that you tried a pill
You feel a little queasy, decidedly ill
You're gonna be sick, but you mustn't lose faith
To let yourself down would be a big disgrace
With the London boys, with the London boys

You're only seventeen, but you think you've grown
In the month you've been away from your parents' home
You take the pills too much
You don't give a damn about that jobs you've got
So long as you're with the London boys

A London boy, oh a London boy
Your flashy clothes are your pride and joy
A London boy, a London boy
You're crying out loud that you're a London boy
You think you've had a lot of fun
But you ain't got nothing, you're on the run
It's too late now, cause you're out there boy
You've got it made with the rest of the toys
Now you wish you'd never left your home
You've got what you wanted but you're on your own
With the London boys
Now you've met the London boys (3 times)

The Man Who Sold The World



We passed upon the stair, we spoke of was and when
Although I wasn't there, he said I was his friend
Which came as some surprise I spoke into his eyes
I thought you died alone, a long long time ago

Oh no, not me
I never lost control
You're face to face
With The Man Who Sold The World

I laughed and shook his hand, and made my way back home
I searched for form and land, for years and years I roamed
I gazed a gazely stare at all the millions here
We must have died along, a long long time ago

Who knows? not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the Man who Sold the World

The Motel



For we're living in a safety zone
Don't be holding back from me
We're living from hour to hour down here
And we'll take it when we can

It's a kind of living which recognizes
The death of the odourless man
When nothing is vanity nothing's too slow
It's not Eden but it's no sham

There is no hell
There is no shame
There is no hell
Like an old hell
There is no hell

And it's lights up, boys
Lights up boys

Explosion falls upon deaf ears
While we're swimming in a sea of sham
Living in the shadow of vanity
A complex fashion for a simple man

And there is no hell
And there is no shame
And there is no hell
Like an old hell
There is no hell

And the silence flies on its brief flight
A razor sharp crap shoot affair
And we light up our lives

And there's no more of me exploding you
Re-exposing you
Like everybody do
Re-exploding you

I don't know what to use
Make somebody move
Me exploding
Me exploding you

The Passenger



I am the passenger
And I ride and I ride
I ride through the city's backsides
I see the stars come
Out of the sky
Yeah the bright and hollow sky
You know it looks
So good tonight

I am the passenger
I stay under glass
I look through my
Window so bright
I see the stars
Come out tonight
I see the bright
And hollow sky
Over the city's
Ripped backside
And everything looks good tonight


  Singing la la la la
  La-la-la-la
  La la la la
  La-la-la-la
  La la la la
  La-la-la-la
  La la

Get into the car
We'll be the passenger
We'll ride through the city tonight
We'll see the city's ripped backsides
We'll see the bright and
Hollow sky
We'll see the stars that shine
So bright
Stars made for us tonight

O the passenger
How how he rides
O the passenger
He rides and he rides
He looks through his window
What does he see
He sees the sign and
Hollow sky
He sees the stars
Come out tonight
He sees the city's ripped backsides
He sees the winding ocean drive
And everything was made
For you and me
All of it was made for
You and me - 'cause it
Just belongs to you and me
So let's take a ride and
See what's mine



O the passenger
He rides and he rides
He sees things from under glass
He looks through his window inside
He sees the things he knows are his
He sees the bright
Hollow sky
He sees the city
Sleep at night
He sees the stars
Come out tonight
And all of it is yours and mine
And all of it is yours and mine
So let's ride and ride
And ride and ride

 (repeat ad. inf.)

The Prettiest Star



Cold fire, you've got everything but cold fire
You will be my rest and peace child
I moved up to take a place near you

So tired, it's the sky that makes you feel tired
It's a trick to make you see wide
It can all but break your heat in pieces

Staying back in your memory
Are the movies in the past
How you moved is all it takes
To sing a song of when I loved
The Prettiest Star

One day though it might as well be someday
You and I will rise up all the way
All because of what you are
The Prettiest Star

Staying back in your memory
Are the movies in the past
How you moved is all it takes
To sing a song of when I loved
The Prettiest Star

One day though it might as well be someday
You and I will rise up all the way
All because of what you are
The Prettiest Star

The Secret Life Of Arabia



The secret life of Arabia
Secret secrets never seen
Secret secrets ever green

I was running at the speed of life
Through morning's thoughts and fantasies
Then I saw your eyes at the cross fades
Secret secrets never seen
Secret secrets ever green

The secret life of Arabia
Never here never seen
Secret life ever green

The secret life of Arabia
You must see the movie the sand in my eyes
I walk through a desert song when the heroine dies

Arabia (secret secret)
Arabia (secret)
Arabia (secret secret)

THREE TIMES:
  Arabia
  Arabia (secret secret)

The secret life of Arabia
Never here never seen
Secret life ever green

The Supermen



When all the world was very young
And mountain magic heavy hung
The supermen would walk in file
Guardians of a loveless isle
And gloomy browed with superfear their tragic endless lives
Could heave nor sigh
In solemn, perverse serenity, wondrous beings chained to life

Strange games they would play then
No death for the perfect men
Life rolls into one for them
So softly a supergod cries

Where all were minds in uni-thought
Power weird by mystics taught
No pain, no joy, no power too great
Colossal strength to grasp a fate
Where sad-eyed mermen tossed in slumbers
Nightmare dreams no mortal mind could hold
A man would tear his brother's flesh, a chance to die
To turn to mold.

Far out in the red-sky
Far out from the sad eyes
Strange, mad celebration
So softly a supergod cries

Far out in the red-sky
Far out from the sad eyes
Strange, mad celebration
So softly a supergod dies


The Wedding


No lyrics for The Wedding

The Wedding Song



These are silver wings
These are golden eyes
These are floating clouds
Angel for life

Dreaming alone and I feel that someone
Listens to me
Angel for life

These are silver wings
These are golden eyes
These are floating clouds
Angel for life

Heaven is smiling down, heaven's girl in a wedding gown
I'm gonna be so good, just like a good boy should
I'm gonna change my ways
Angel for life

Of all the saints alive
Don't I feel like a saint alive
She's not mine for eternity
Though I'll never fly so high
I'm smiling

I believe in magic
Angel for life

The Width Of A Circle



In the corner of the morning in the past
I would sit and blame the master first and last
All the roads were straight and narrow
And the prayers were small and yellow
And the rumour spread that I was aging fast
Then I ran across a monster who was sleeping
By a tree.
And I looked and frowned and the monster was me

Well, I said hello and I said hello
And I asked "Why not?" and I replied "I don't know"
So we asked a simple black bird, who was happy as can be
And he laughed insane and quipped "KAHLIL GIBRAN"
So I cried for all the others till the day was nearly through
For I realized that God's a young man too

So I said "So long" and I waved "Bye-bye"
And I smashed my soul and traded my mind
Got laid by a young bordello
I was vaguely half asleep
For which my reputation swept back home in drag
And the moral of this magic spell
Negotiates my hide
When God did take my logic for a ride
(Riding along)

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

He swallowed his pride and puckered his lips
And showed me the leather belt round his hips
My knees were shaking my cheeks aflame
He said "You'll never go down to the Gods again"
(Turn around,go back!)

He struck the ground a cavern appeared
And I smelt the burning pit of fear
We crashed a thousand yards below
I said "Do it again, do it again"
(Turn around,go back!)

His nebulous body swayed above
His tongue swollen with devil's love
The snake and I, a venom high
I said "Do it again, do it again"
(Turn around, go back!)

Breathe, breathe, breathe deeply
And I was seething, breathing deeply
Spitting sentry, horned and tailed
Waiting for you

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

The Wild Eyed Boy From Freecloud



Solemn faced
The village settles down
Undetected by the stars
And the hangman plays the mandolin before he goes to sleep
And the last thing on his mind
Is the Wild Eyed Boy imprisoned
'Neath the covered wooden shaft
Folds the rope
Into its bag
Blows his pipe of smolders
Blankets smoke into the room
And the day will end for some
As the night begins for one

Staring through the message in his eyes
Lies a solitary son
From the mountain called Freecloud
Where the eagle dare not fly
And the patience in his sigh
Gives no indication
For the townsmen to decide
So the village Dreadful yawns
Pronouncing gross diversion
As the label for the dog
Oh "It's the madness in his eyes"
As he breaks the night to cry:

   "It's really Me
    Really You
    And really Me
    It's so hard for us to really be
    Really You
    And really Me
    You'll lose me though I'm always really free"

And the mountain moved its eyes
To the world of realize
Where the snow had saved a place
For the Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud

And the women once proud
Clutched the heart of the crowd
As theboulders smashed down from the mountain's hand
And the Magic in the stare
Of the Wild Eyed Boy said
   "Stop, Freecloud
    They won't think to cut me down"
But the cottages fell
Like a playing card hell
And the tears on the face
Of the Wise Boy
Came tumbling down
To the rumbling ground
And the missionary mystic of peace/love
Stumbled to cry among the clouds
Kicking back the pebbles
From the Freecloud mountain
Track.

There Is A Happy Land



There is a happy land where only children live
They don't have the time to learn the ways
Of you sir, Mr. Grownup

There's a special place in the rhubarb fields underneath the leaves
It's a secret place and adults aren't allowed there, Mr. Grownup
Go away, sir

Charlie Brown got's half a crown, he's gonna buy a kite
Jimmy's ill with chicken pox, and Tommy's learned to ride his bike
Tiny Tim sings prayers and hymns, he's so small we don't notice him
He gets in the way but we always let him play with us

Mother calls, but we don't hear
There's lots more things to do
It's only 5 o'clock, and we're not tired yet
But we will be, very shortly

Sissy Steven plays with girls, someone made him cry
Tony climbed a tree and fell, trying hard to touch the sky
Tommy lit a fire one day, nearly burned the field away
Tommy's mum found out, but he put the blame on me and Ray

There is a happy land where only children live
You've had your chance and now the doors are closed sir, Mr. Grownup
Go away, sir

Boo, de boo, de boo, de boo dup 

Things To Do



Sometimes, sometimes I feel blue(?)
When I'm, when I'm feeling good(?)
All I, all I have to do
Is think of you, you, you
And the things you do, do, do

I don't know the reason
That you've got me this way
But when I first met you
Oh happy day
I'll make my point here
I just gotta say
I love you, you, you
And the things you do, do, do

Well if the lord is my shepherd
And Peter was a saint
It's kind of obvious to me
Big guy, a ???? you ain't
But if you turned at the ????
I was cunning and mean
I'd have to think maybe
That the lord himself could save me

Sometimes, sometimes I feel blue(?)
When I'm, when I'm feeling good(?)
All I, all I have to do
Is think of you, you, you
And the things you do, do, do

This Is Not America



This is not America, sha la la la la

A little piece of you
The little peace in me
Will die [This is not a miracle]
For this is not America

Blossom fails to bloom
This season
Promise not to stare
Too long [This is not America]
For this is not the miracle

There was a time
A storm that blew so pure
For this could be the biggest sky
And I could have
The faintest idea

[For this is not America, sha la la la la, sha la la la la, sha la la la la
This is not america, no, this is not, sha la la la la]

Snowman melting
From the inside
Falcon spirals
To the ground [This could be the biggest sky]
So bloody red
Tomorrow's clouds

A little piece of you
The little piece in me
Will die [This could be a miracle]
For this is not America

There was a time
A wind that blew so young
For this could be the biggest sky
And I could have the faintest idea

[For this is not America, sha la la la la, sha la la la la, sha la la la la
 This is not america, no, this is not, sha la la la
 This is not america, no, this is not
 This is not america, no, this is not, sha la la la]

Thru These Architect's Eyes



 (?? - bringing the golden, it's the golden, it's the golden??)

Stomping along on this big Phillip Johnson
Is delay just wasting my time
Looking across at Richard Rogers
Scheming dreams to blow both their minds

It's difficult you see
To give up baby
To leave a job
When you know
You know the money's from day to day


  All the majesty of a city landscape
  All the soaring days in our lives
  All the concrete dreams in my mind's eye
  All the joy I see
  Thru these architect's eyes

Cold winter bleeds on the girders of Babel
This stone boy watching the crawling land
Rings of flesh and the towers of iron
The steaming caves and the rocks and the sand

Stomping along on this big Phillip Johnson
Is delay just wasting my time
It's difficult you see
To give up baby
These summer scumholes
This goddamned starving life



It's difficult you see
It's difficult you see



Time



Time - He's waiting in the wings
       He speaks of senseless things
       His script is you and me boys

Time - He flexes like a whore
       Falls wanking to the floor
       His trick is you and me, boy

Time - In Quaaludes and red wine
       Demanding Billy Dolls
       And other friends of mine
       Take your time

The sniper in the brain, regurgitating drain
Incestuous and vain, and many other last names
I look at my watch it say 9:25 and I think "Oh God I'm still alive"

We should be on by now
We should be on by now

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la (repeat)

You - are not a victim
You - just scream with boredom
You - are not evicting time

Chimes - Goddamn, you're looking old
         You'll freeze and catch a cold
         'Cause you've left your coat behind
         Take your time

Breaking up is hard, but keeping dark is hateful
I had so many dreams, I had so many breakthroughs
But you, my love, were kind, but love has left you dreamless
The door to dreams was closed.  Your park was real dreamless
Perhaps you're smiling now, smiling through this darkness
But all I had to give was the guilt for dreaming

We should be on by now (x5)
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la (repeat)

Yeah, time!

Time Will Crawl



I've never sailed on a sea
I would not challenge a giant
I could not take on the church
Time will crawl
Till the 21st century lose

I know a government man
He was as blind as the moon
He saw the sun in the night
He took a top-gun pilot
He made him fly thru a hole
Till he grew real old
And he never came down
He just flew till he burst

Time will crawl till our mouths run dry
Time will crawl till our feet grow small
Time will crawl till our tails fall off
Time will crawl till the 21st century lose

I saw a black black stream
Full of white eyed fish
And a drowning man
With no eyes at all
I felt a warm warm breeze
That melted metal and steel
I got a bad migraine
That lasted three long years
And the pills that I took
Made my fingers disappear

Time will crawl, time will crawl
Time will crawl
Till the 21st century lose

You were a talented child
You came to live in our town
We never bothered to scream
When your mask came off
We only smelt the gas
As we lay down to sleep

Time will crawl and our heads bowed down
Time will crawl and our eyes fall out
Time will crawl and the streets run red
Time will crawl till the 21st century lose

Time will crawl and our mouths run dry
Time will crawl and our feet grow small
Time will crawl and our tails fall off
Time will crawl till the 21st century lose

Time will crawl and our heads bowed down
Time will crawl and our eyes fall out
Time will crawl and the streets run red
Time will crawl till the 21st century lose

For the crazy child
We'll give every life
For the crackpot notion

Tin Machine



Tin machine
Tin machine

Take me anywhere
somewhere without alcohol
Or goons with muddy hair

Tin machine
Tin machine

Tin machine
Tin machine

The zombies that I pass
The guy that beats his baby up
The preachers and their past

Tin machine
Tin machine

Tin machine

Baby doll
Baby doll

Clarity and power
There's more than money moving here
There's mindless maggot glare
Working horrors-humping Tories
Spittle on their chins
Carving up my children's future
Read 'em pal and grin

Raging raging raging
Burning in my room
C'mon and get a good idea
C'mon and get it soon
I'm waiting on the fire escape
I'm not exactly well
I'm neither red nor black nor white
I'm grey and blown to hell

Tin machine
Tin machine

Make some new computer thing
That puts me on the moon
Not this psycho-time-bomb planet
Poised to meet its maker
Shake a leg

Tin machine
Tin machine

One sick deathless duty to remain endangered species
They reach right out to touch someone
Then wash their crusty hands

Tin machine
Tin machine

Baby doll
Baby doll

Blue suede tuneless wonders
Mass confusion-faithless blues
Night that spews out watchmen
Mopping up another fortune
Fractured words and branca-sonic
Anger trapped behind locked doors
And right between the eyes

Tiny Girls



Well the day begins
You don't want to live
'Cause you can't believe
In the one you're with
'Cause you know her tricks
And you know her past
When she makes a face
You just have to laugh
And you feel like such a know-it-all
When you only want just a tiny girl
And you hope she'll sing

So you turn around
Toward the tiny girls
Who have got no tricks
Who have got no past
Yea that's what you think
And you hope she'll sing
But she sings of greed
Like a young banshee
And she wants for this
And she wants for that
What did you think

Tired Of My Life



I don't know why, but I'm tired of my mind
Pain is over me, over loading
I don't know why, but you're trying to be kind
Take off your silver smile, throw your head back
And cry, ahhh...

I don't believe, but I'm trying to decide
Which game is best for me, which can I bear
You don't perceive, so I'm leading you away
Home where you've never been, non-returning
So cry, ahhh...

Throw a rock upon a road, and it breaks into pieces
Shake a branch upon the snow, the sun is defeated
Pull the curtains on yesterday, and it seems so much later
Put a bullet in my brain, and I make all the papers
Ahhh...

I don't know why, but I'm tired of my life
The clouds are in my eyes, overtaking
Ahhh..."

Tonight



VERSE *
  I saw my baby
  She was turning blue
  I knew that soon
  Her young life was through
  And so I got down on my knees
  Down by her bed
  And these are the words
  To her I said

Everything will be alright tonight
Everything will be alright tonight
No one moves
No one talks
No one thinks
No one walks tonight
Tonight
Everyone will be alright tonight
Everyone will be alright tonight
No one moves
No one talks
No one thinks
No one walks tonight
Tonight

I am gonna love you till the end
I will love you till I reach the end
I will love you till I die
I will see you in the sky
Tonight

Too Dizzy



There's too much talking for a night drive
Too much mist in front of my eyes
I'm trying not to lose control
But you're just pushin' for a fight
You look trapped, turn the radio on
Too much smoke, air conditioning gone
But I'm helpless in love with you
But you're just looking for a break

Is it love or is it what
Who's this guy I'm gonna blow away
What kind of love is he giving you
I'm-a-dizzy's what I'm trying to say
Too Dizzy-You can't have a lover
Too Dizzy-It's me and no other
I'm a bad loser-I'm-a-shakin' in anger
Too Dizzy-you can't have no lover

2nd time: Don't come any harder
          Don't come any closer

You can go on dreaming every night
But I'm not letting you out of my sight
I'm-a-ten times the man than any guy around
But you're just itchin'-twitchin'-itchin' for a break

There's too much talking for a night drive
Too much mist in front of my eyes
But I'm helpless in love with you
But you're just looking for a break

Is it love or is it what...

Tumble And Twirl



I've seen the city
I took the next flight
for Borneo
They say it's pretty
I like the tee shirts
in Borneo
Some wear Bob Marley
Others in Playboy
or Duvalier
Make the last plane come
Let me rise through the cloudy above
with a book on Borneo

Strangers come and go
It's such a waste of time
Problems far behind
Another day
But even in springtime
It's a rich slice of life
So send me a letter
I'll reply with a postcard
That dusky mulatto
In nylons and tattoos
Hot juice in coke bottles
We dance in the sand
Well, they twirl and they tumble

Yes, they twirl and they tumble
Well, I'll twirl and I'll tumble
I've been to Leon's
He's got nine daughters
And a stereo
They say that Leon
Watches from the tree tops
in Borneo
When the road is mud
Everything stops with a thud
That's the way it goes down yonder in Borneo
Far beneath his mansion
There's an open drain
Sending all the sewage down the hill
But when the general shows movies
No one hesitates
To sneak from the jungle
They laugh and they mumble
Enjoying the show
And that dusky mulatto

Hot juice in coke bottles
In Blue Jeans and tattoos
Well, they twirl and they tumble
Yes, they twirl and they tumble
Well, I'll twirl and I'll tumble

I like the free world
They say it's pretty
This time of year
They tumble and twirl
They tumble and twirl
I'll tumble and twirl

They twirl and they tumble
They twirl and they tumble

I like the free world
I like the free world

They say it's pretty

This time of year
This time of year

Turn Blue



See a black Eldorado
Rolling along down below my window
That black girl in the back looks pretty good
Christ! She's beautiful
You know how soft she is
I know just what it'd feel like
I'm so far away from her
Jesus, this is Iggy

You might as well
Come with me
Then you ride
There's talk
And I don't wanna talk
Oh momma
I shot myself down
Oh momma
I shot myself down
Ohhh, momma
I shot myself down
Oooh, momma
Did I tell you
I shot myself down

They're stepping on our hearts [stepping on our hearts]
Stepping on our hearts
I don't know why
They're stepping on our hearts [stepping on our hearts]
Stepping on our hearts
Damn, I don't know why
They're stepping on our hearts
Stepping on our hearts (x4)
Can't you see
Stepping on our hearts

How come the blacks
How come they come to you so good?
They get off on you so sexually
If you wanna make it
Young man, you've gotta make somebody come
Come out of you black
Come out of you black and strong
Black and strong
Black and strong
Black
Strong
Black

Jesus it's cold in this room
You know I, I never told you 'bout this
But there's one guy - somebody I really love
He's never around
We'd take things that could be alright, that could be nice
And make 'em so ugly, so damned ugly
And we put out the lights on'm
We make it dark, we put out the lights!
On them
It's idiots like you that screw me up
I know there's nothing to you
And I don't know why I treat you so kind
Up, down and dance with me
Dance with me
You got nobody left but me
Accept me
Don't reject me
Don't forget me

Momma
What color will the lights be?
Will they turn blow on me?
Momma
What color will the lights be?
Will they turn blue on me?
Momma [will they turn blue on me]
I shot myself up
Oh momma
I shot myself [up, up, up, up, up, up]
Momma
I shot myself up [up, up, up, up, up]
Momma
I shot myself up
Down
Up
Down
Momma
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Momma
I didn't know what I was doing
I didn't mean to
But I did
Shot myself

Uncle Arthur



Strikes the bell for 5 o'clock, Uncle Arthur closes shop
Screws the tops on all the bottles, turns the lights out, locks it up
Climbs across his bike and he's away
Cycles past the gasworks, past the river, down the high street
Back to mother, it's another empty day

Uncle Arthur likes his mommy
Uncle Arthur still reads comics
Uncle Arthur follows Batman

Round and round the rumours fly, how he ran away from Mum
On his 32nd birthday, told her that he'd found a chum
Mother cried and raved and yelled and fussed
Arthur left her no illusion, brought the girl round, save confusion
Sally was the real thing, not just lust

Uncle Arthur vanished quickly
Uncle Arthur and his new bride
Uncle Arthur follows Sally

Round and round goes Arthur's head, hasn't eaten well for days
Little Sally may be lovely, but cooking leaves her in a maze
Uncle Arthur packed his bags and fled
Back to mother, all's forgiven, serving in the family shop
He gets his pocket money, he's well fed

Uncle Arthur past the gasworks
Uncle Arthur past the river
Uncle Arthur down the high street
Uncle Arthur follows mother

Under Pressure



Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah
Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah

Pressure, pushing down on me
Pressing down on you, no man ask for
Under pressure, that burns a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets

Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah
Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah

That's o-kay
It's the terror of knowing
What this world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming `Let me out'
Pray tomorrow takes me higher
Pressure on people, people on streets

Doh doh doh bah bah bah bah
O-kay
Chipping around, kick my brains around the floor
These are the days it never rains but it pours
People on streets, people on streets

It's the terror of knowing
What this world is about,
Watching some good friends
Screaming `Let me out'
Pray tomorrow takes me higher
Pressure on people, people on streets

Turned away from it all, like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
Keep coming up with love
But it's so slashed and torn
Why why why?
Love love love love

Insanity laughs, under pressure we're cracking
Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love one more chance
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love, give love

Cause love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care
For the people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves

This is our last dance
This is ourselves
Under pressure
Under pressure
Pressure

Under The God



Skin dance back-a-the condo
Skin heads getting to school
Beating on Blacks with a baseball bat
Racism back in rule

White trash picking up Nazi flags
While you was gone,  there was war
This is the West, get used to it
They put a swastika over the door


  Under the God
  Under the God
  One step over the red line
  Under the God
  Under the God
  Ten steps into the crazy

Washington heads in the toilet bowl
Don't see supremicist hate
Right wing dicks in their boiler suits
Picking out who to annihilate

Toxic jungle of Uzi trails
Tribesmen just wouldn't live here
Fascist flare is fashion cool
Wel, you're dead-you just ain't buried (yet)



As the walls came tumbling down
So, the secrets  that we shared
I believed you by the palace gates.
Now the savage days are here

Under the gods
Crazy eyed man with a shot gun
Hot headed creep with a knife
Love and peace and harmony
Love you could cult with a life



Underground



No one can blame you
For walking away
Too much rejection
No love injection
Life can be easy
It's not always swell
Don't tell me truth hurts, little girl
'Cause it hurts like hell (echo)
But down in the underground (oh oh oh oh oh)
You'll find someone true (down underground)
Down in the underground (oh oh oh oh oh)
A land serene (oh oh oh oh)
A crystal moon, ah, ah

It's only forever
Not long at all
Lost and lonely
That's underground

Untitled No. 1



In mornings she's so regal that the valley sighs
In the chilly sea that killed her real slow
Now we're swimming up farther with the doll by our sides
Fill the cup with these sleepy souls


  (?? Seemecargo ??)
  It's clear that some things never take
  (?? Seemecargo ??)
  Please, heal these tears
  (?? Seemecargo ??)

She will feel like at tea, make me laugh all along
With such feats like sex only brought upon
Oh lady, oh baby, maybe I'll live my lies alone
Jesus, up here, hear me, I, up-up-up ??



Please heal these tears

 repeat

Some things never
Never never

Unwashed and Somewhat Slightly Dazed



Spy, spy, pretty girl
I see you see me through your window
Don't turn your nose up
Well, you can if you need to, you won't be the first or last
It must strain you to look down so far from your father's house
And I know what a louse like me in his house could do for you
I'm the Cream
Of the Great Utopia Dream
And you're the gleam
In the depths of your banker's spleen

I'm a phallus in pigtails
And there's blood on my nose
And my tissue is rotting
Where the rats chew my bones
And my eye sockets empty
See nothing but pain
I keep having this brainstorm
About twelve times a day
So now, you could spend the morning walking with me, quite amazed
As I'm Unwashed and Somewhat Slightly Dazed

I got eyes in my backside
That see electric tomatoes
On credit card rye bread
There are children in washrooms
Holding hands with a queen
And my heads full of murders
Where only killers scream
So now you ould spend the morning talking with me quite amazed
Look out, I'm raving mad and Somewhat Slightly Dazed

Now you run from your window
To the porcelain bowl
And you're sick from your ears
To the red parquet floor
And the Braque on the wall
Slides down your front
And eats through your belly
It's very catchhing
So now, you should spend the mornings lying to your father quite amazed
About the strange Unwashed and Happily Slightly Dazed.

Up The Hill Backwards



The vacuum created by the arrival of freedom
And the possibilities it seems to offer
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it

A series of shocks - sneakers fall aart
Earth keeps on rolling - witnesses falling
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it

Yeah, yeah, yeah - up the hill backwards
It'll be alright ooo-ooo

While we sleep they go to work
We're legally crippled it's the death of love
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it

More idols thean realities
I'm OK, you're so-so

Yeah, yeah, yeah - up the hill backwards
It'll be alright ooo-ooo

Velvet Goldmine



You got crazy legs, you got amazin' head
You got rings on your fingers and your hair's hot red
You got the width of my tongue name on the sun
I clutch you close to my breast
Cause you're the only one, who uses school to pleasure

You make me act real gone, you make me troll along
I had to ravish your capsule, suck you dry
Feel the teeth in your bones, heal ya head with my own
Why if I don't have you whole, is that your final love?
Here all together


  Velvet goldmine, you stroke me like the rain
  Snake it, take it, panther princess you must stay
  Velvet goldmine, naked on your chain
  I'll be your kimba kano right for you again and again
  My velvet goldmine

You're my taste, my trip, I'll be your master zip
I'll chop your hair off for kicks, you'll make me jump to my feet
So you'll give me your hand, give me your sound
Let my sea wash your face, I'm falling, I can't stand
Oooh! Put your mink on



Oh
Shoot you down, bang bang



(hum) Velvet Goldmine  (repeat)

Video Crime



Ain't got room for charity
Me, I'm crawling with no cash
Me, I'm looking for hot flesh

This skeleton's mine
Chop it up
Chop it up

Blood on video-video crime
Video crime
Needles and pins and video crime
Video crime
I've got dollars-I've got sense
Wonder where the Third World went

Aint got time for honeymoon (chop it up)
Trash Time Bundy, Death Row Chic (chop it up)
Haunt this street from half past ten (chop it up)

Blood on video-video crime
Video crime
Needles and pins and video crime
Video crime
Late night cannibal-cripples decay
Just can't tear my eyes away

Ain't got no room for charity (this skeleton's mine)
Ain't got room for Hollywood (chop it up)
Me, I'm crawling with no cash (chop it up)
Blood on video-video crime
Video crime
Needles and pins and video crime
Video crime
I've got dollars I've got sense
Wonder where the Third World went

Voyeur Of Utter Destruction (As Beauty)



Turn, and turn again
Turn, and turn again

I shake
And stare at the sun
Till my eyes burn

I shake
At the mothers brutal vermin

I shake
And stare at the watery moon
With the same desire
As the sober Philistine
I shake

Turn and turn again

Worm, the pain and blade
Turn and turn again

The screw
Is a tightening Atrocity

I shake
For the reeking flesh
Is as romantic as hell

The need
To have seen it all

The Voyeur of Utter Destruction
As beauty
I shake

Turn and turn again

I shake
Turn and turn again
I shake

I shake
I shake

VERSE (two times)
  Research has pierced
  All extremes of my sex
  Call it a day
  Call it a day
  Needle point life
  Blinds the will to be next
  Call it a day
  Call it a day

Call it a day (repeat ad. inf)
Today (repeat ad. inf)

Watch That Man



Shakey threw a party that lasted all night
Everybody drank a lot of something nice
There was an old fashioned band of married men
Looking up to me for encouragement - it was so-so

The ladies looked bad but the music was sad
No one took their eyes off Lorraine
She shimmered and she strolled like a Chicago moll
Her feathers looked better and better - it was so-so

Yea! it was time to unfreeze
When the Reverend Alabaster danced on his knees
Slam! so it wasn't a game
Cracking all the mirrors in shame


  Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man
  He talks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and spoon
  Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man
  He walks like a jerk
  But he's only taking care of the room
  Must be in tune

A Benny Goodman fan painted holes in his hands
So Shakey hung him up to dry
The pundits were hoking the manholes were smoking
And every bottle battled with the reason why

The girl on the phone wouldn't leave me alone
A throw back from someone's LP
A lemon in a bag played the Tiger Rag
And the bodies on the screen stopped bleeding

Yeah! I was shaking like a leaf
For I couldn't understand the conversation
Yeah! I ran to the street, looking for information



Watch that man 

We Are Hungry Men



(spoken)
Here is the news
According to the latest world population survey
The figures have reached danger point, my god
London 15 million 75 thousand
New York 80 million
Paris 15 million and 30
China 1000 million
Billington-Spa: lots

My studies included suffragy
I formed my own society
to study the power of fecundity
The world will overpopulate
Unless you claim infertility
So who will buy a drink for me, your messiah

We are not your friends
We don't give a damn for what you're saying
We're here to live our lives

I propose to give the pill
Free of charge to those that feel
That they are not infertible
The crops of few, the cattle gun
There's only one way to linger on
So who will buy a drink for me, your messiah

We are not your friends
We don't give a damn for what you're saying
We're here to live our lives

(spoken)
Achtung, achtung, these are your orders
Anyone found guilty of consuming more than their allotted amount of air
Will be slaughtered and cremated
Only one cubic foot of air is...

I have prepared a document, legalising mass abortion
We will turn a blind eye to infanticide

We are not your friends
We don't give a damn for what you're saying
We're here to live our lives

You don't seem to hear me clear
Do I talk above your sphere?
Let me explain my project dear
Show you how I'll save the world
Or let it die within the year
Why do you look that way at me, your messiah

We are not your friends
We don't give a damn for what you're saying
We're here to live our lives

We are hungry men
We don't give a damn for what you're saying
We're here to eat you

We Are The Dead



Something kind of hit me today
I looked at you and wondered if you saw things my way
People will hold us to blame
It hit me today, it hit me today

We're taking it hard all the time
Why don't we pass it by?
Just reply, you've changed your mind
We're fighting with the eyes of the blind
Taking it hard, taking it hard

Yet now
We feel that we are paper, choking on you nightly
They tell me "Son, we want you, be elusive, but don't walk far"
For we're breaking in the new boys, deceive your next of kin
For you're dancing where the dogs decay, defecating ecstasy
You're just an ally of the leecher
Locator for the virgin King, but I love you in your fuck-me pumps
And your nimble dress that trails
Oh, dress yourself, my urchin one, for I hear them on the rails
Because of all we've seen, because of all we've said
We are the dead

One thing kind of touched me today
I looked at you and counted all the times we had laid
Pressing our love through the night
Knowing it's right, knowing it's right

Now I'm hoping some one will care
Living on the breath of a hope to be shared
Trusting on the sons of our love
That someone will care, someone will care

But now
We're today's scrambled creatures, locked in tomorrow's double feature
Heaven's on the pillow, its silence competes with hell
It's a twenty-four hour service, guaranteed to make you tell
And the streets are full of press men
Bent on getting hung and buried
And the legendary curtains are drawn 'round Baby Bankrupt
Who sucks you while you're sleeping
It's the theater of financiers
Count them, fifty 'round a table
White and dressed to kill

Oh caress yourself, my juicy
For my hands have all but withered
Oh dress yourself my urchin one, for I hear them on the stairs
Because of all we've seen, because of all we've said
We are the dead
We are the dead
We are the dead

We Prick You



White boys falling on the fires of night
  (I wish you'd tell, I wish you'd tell)
Flesh punks burning in their glue
Revolution comes in the strangest way
  (I wish you'd tell, I wish you'd tell)
I'd rather be inside you

1 (twice)
  Tell the truth
  Tell the truth
  Tell the truth
  We prick you we prick you we prick you

2 (twice)
  You show respect even if you disagree
  You show respect

Mama can I kiss you daddy can I tell
  (we wish you well, we wish you well)
Innocence passed me by
Wanna be screwing when the nightmare comes
  (I wish you well, I wish you well)
Wanna come quick and die

1 (twice)



All the little rose-kissed foxy girls
Shoes, shoes, little white shoes
Where have all the flowers gone
All the little fragile champion boys
Toys, toys, little black toys
Dripping on the end of a gun

Even if you disagree

1 (twice)

2 (twice)

Shoes, shoes, little white shoes
  (even if you disagree, even if you disagree)
Toys, toys, little black toys
Wish you well, wish you well

Shoes, shoes, little white shoes
Wish you well, wish you well

What In The World



You're just a little girl with grey eyes
Never mind, say something
Wait until the crowd cries
Oh, wait until the crowd cries
You're just a little girl with grey eyes

So deep in your room, you never leave your room
Something deep inside of me - yearning deep inside of me
Talking through the gloom
What in the world can you do
What in the world can you do
I'm in the mood for your love
For your love
For your love

Oh

I'm just a little bit afraid of you
Cause love won't make you cry
But, wait until the crowd goes
Oh, Wait until the crowd goes
I'm just a little bit afraid of you

So deep in your room, you never leave your room
Something deep inside of me - yearning deep inside of me
Talking through the gloom
What in the world can I do
What in the world can I do
I'm in the mood for your love
For your love
For your love

Oh, what you gonna say?
Oh, what you gonna do?
Ah, what you gonna be?

Just the real me to the real me
Under the *cool*, to the *cool* and under *fame*
What you gonna say to the real me, to the real me
Ahhhh, ahhhh, ahhhh, ahhhh 

When I Live My Dream



When I live my dream, I'll take you with me
Riding on a golden horse
We'll live within my castle, with people there to serve you
Happy at the sound of your voice

Baby, I'll slay a dragon for you
Or banish wicked giants from the land
But you will find, that nothing in my dream can hurt you
We will only love each other as forever
When I live my dream

When I live my dream, I'll forgive the things you've told me
And the empty man you left behind
It's a broken heart that dreams, it's a broken heart you left me
Only love can live in my dream

I'll wish, and the thunder clouds will vanish
Wish, and the storm will fade away
Wish again, and you will stand before me while the sky will paint an overture
And trees will play the rhythm of my dream

When I live my dream, please be there to meet me
Let me be the one to understand
When I live my dream, I'll forget the hurt you gave me
Then we can live in our new land

Till the day my dream cascades around me
I'm content to let you pass me by
Till that day, you'll run to many other men
But let them know it's just for now
Tell them that I've got a dream
And tell them you're the starring role
Tell them I'm a dreaming kind of guy
And I'm going to make my dream
Tell them I will live my dream
Tell them they can laugh at me
But don't forget your date with me
When I live my dream

When I'm Five



When I'm five
I will wash my face and hands all by myself
When I'm five
I will chew and spit tabacco, like my grandfather Jones
'Cause I'm only four and five is far away

When I'm five
I will read the magazines in mummy's drawer
When I'm five
I will wall behind the soldiers in the May Day parade
'Cause I'm only four and grown-ups walk too fast

Yesterday was horrid day, 'cause Raymond kicked my shin
And mummy says if I am good, she'll let me go to school in August
Daddy shouted loud at mummy and I dropped my toast at breakfast
And I laughed when Bonzo licked my face, because it tickled

I wonder why my daddy cries and how I wish that I was nearly five

When I'm five
I will catch a butterfly and eat it and I won't be sick
When I'm five
I will jump in puddles, laugh in church and marry my mum
And I'll let my daddy do the washing-up

If I close one eye, the people on that side can't see me
I get headaches in the morning and I rode on Freddie's tricycle
And everywhere was funny, when I ran down to the sweetshop
Then I fell and bleeded-up my knee and everybody soppied me

I saw a photograph of Jesus and I asked him if he'd make me five
I saw a photograph of Jesus and I asked him if he'd make me five
When I'm five
When I'm five
When I'm... oah...

When The Wind Blows



So long child, I'm on my way
And after all is done, after all is done
Don't be down, it's all in the past
Though you may be afraid

So long child, it's awful dark
And I've never felt the sun
I daren't to think of when
When the wind blows

When the wind blows
When the wind blows

Life burns a savage wound, angry and wrong
Trusting a twisted word, you'll run, run away
You'll take him home
You'll spit and taunt him
But they won't believe you
No matter what you'll say

So long child, it's awful dark
I never felt the sun
I daren't to think of when
When the wind blows

When the wind blows

Where Have All The Good Times Gone



In my life I've never stopped to worry about a thing
Opened up and shouted out and never tried to see
Wondering if I'd done wrong
Will this depression last for long


  Won't you tell me
  Where have all the good times gone
  Where have all the good times gone
  Where have all the good times gone

Once we had an easy ride and always felt the same
Time was on our side and I had everything to gain
Let it be like yesterday
Please let me have happy days

Ma and Pa looked back on all the things they used to do
Didn't have no money and they always told the truth
Daddy didn't have no toys
And Mummy didn't need no boys



Yesterday was such an easy game for you to play
But let's face it things are so much easier today
Guess you need some bringing down
Get your feet back on the ground

Who Can I Be Now



Everybody's raised in blindness
Everybody knows it's true
Everybody feels that everything is real
Anybody's point of view

Nobody can break their bondage
Everyone can feel their chains
But even in my life I knew you found your sight
And nothing would be quite the same

Please help me
Who can I be now? You found me
Who can I be? Fell apart, you found me
Now can I be now? You found me
Now can I be real?
Can I be real? (somebody real)

Hmmm, if it's all a vast creation
Putting on a face that's new
Someone has to see, a role for him and me
Someone might as well be you

Up in heaven, any angel
Writes a special game to play
Oh-oh, could we, could we make a star to snatch their angels, boy
Played your role for every day

Please help me
Who can I be now? You found me
Who can I be? Fell apart, you found me
Now can I be now? You found me
Now can I be real? Can I be?

Who can I be now? You found me
Who can I be? Fell upon, you found me
Now can I be now? You found me
Now can I, can I be real? Can I be real?
Can I be real? Can I be?
(Who) can I be?
Yeah, yeah
(Now) Yeah, can I be (now)?
You found me
(Now) can I be free?
Can I...

Wild Is The Wind



Love me, love me, love me, say you do
Let me fly away with you
For my love is like the wind, and wild is the wind
Wild is the wind
Give me more than one caress, satisfy this hungriness
Let the wind blow through your heart
For wild is the wind, wild is the wind


  You touch me, I hear the sound of mandolins
  You kiss me
  With your kiss my life begins
  You're spring to me, all things to me
  Don't you know, you're life itself!

Like the leaf clings to the tree,
Oh, my darling, cling to me
For we're like creatures of the wind, and wild is the wind
Wild is the wind



Like the leaf clings to the tree,
Oh, my darling, cling to me
For we're like creatures in the wind, and wild is the wind

Wild is the wind (4 times)

Win



  (Hey, it ain't over)

Me, I hope that I'm crazy
I feel you driving and you're only the wheel
Slow down, let someone love you
Ohh, I've never touched you since I started to feel
If there's nothing to hide me
Then you've never seen me hanging naked and wired
Somebody lied, but I say it's hip
To be alive


  Now your smile is spreading thin
  Seems you're trying not to lose
  Since I'm not supposed to grin
  All you've got to do is win

  (that's all ya gotta do)
  (ooh, it ain't over)

Me, I'm fresh on your pages
Secret thinker sometimes listening aloud
Life lies dumb on its heroes
Wear your wound with honor, make someone proud
Someone like you should not be allowed
To start any fires



  (that's all ya gotta do)
  (ohh, it ain't over)



(thats all ya gotta do, ohh)
All you've got to do is win
  (it ain't over)
When your smile is spreading thin
  (seek and believe in you)
Since you're trying not to lose
  (it ain't over, no, no)
Since I'm not supposed to grin
  (that's all ya gotta do)
All you've got to do is win
  (it ain't over, no)
  (seek and believe in you)
All you've got to do is win
  (it ain't over, no, no)
Wo-ohh, all you've got
Is all you've got
  (it ain't over)
It ain't over...

Wishful Beginnings



Cruising around me the flames burn my body
Wishful beginnings
Does this remind them again & again
You're a sorry little girl
You're a sorry little girl
Please hide, for the pain must feel like snow
You're a sorry little girl
Sorry little girl

Please hide from the kiss and the bite
Shame burns
Breathing in, breathing out
Breathing in, only doubt
The pain must feel like snow
I'm no longer your golden boy
Sorry little girl
I'm sorry little girl

The pain must feel like snow
There you go
Cover me, cover me
We flew on the wings
We were deep in the dead air
And this one will never go down

We had such wishful beginnings
But we lived unbearable lives
I'm sorry little girl
Sorry little girl
So so sorry little girl

The pain must feel like snow
There you go
There you go

Within You



How you turned my world, you precious thing
You starve and near exhaust me
Everything I've done, I've done for you
I move the stars for no one
You've run so long
You've run so far
Your eyes can be so cruel
Just as I can be so cruel
Though I do believe in you
Yes I do
Live without the sunlight
Love without your heartbeat
I, I can't live within you
I can't live within you
(sigh)
I, I can't live within you

Without You



Just when I'm ready to throw in my hand
Just when the best things in life are gone
I look into your eyes

There's no smoke without fire
You're exactly who I want to be with
Without you
What would I do

And when I'm willing to call it a day
Just when I won't take another chance
I hold your hand
There's no smoke without fire
Woman I love you
Without you
What would I do

Word On A Wing



In this age of grand illusion you walked into my life out of my dreams
I don't need another change, still you forced away into my scheme of things
You say we're growing, growing heart and soul
In this age of grand illusion you walked into my life out of my dreams
Sweet name, you're born once again for me
Sweet name, you're born once again for me
Oh sweet name, I call you again, you're born once again for me
Just because I believe don't mean I don't think as well
Don't have to question everything in heaven or hell


  Lord, I kneel and offer you my word on a wing
  And I'm trying hard to fit among your scheme of things
  It's safer than a strange land, but I still care for myself
  And I don't stand in my own light
  Lord, lord, my prayer flies like a word on a wing
  My prayer flies like a word on a wing
  Does my prayer fit in with your scheme of things?

In this age of grand illusion you walked into my life out of my dreams
Sweet name, you're born once again for me
just as long as I can see, I'll never stop this vision flowing
I look twice and you're still flowing
Just as long as I can walk
I'll walk beside you, I'm alive in you
Sweet name, you're born once again for me
And I'm ready to shape the scheme of things

Ooh, ready to shape the scheme of things (5 times)
Ooh...

Lord, I kneel and offer you my word on a wing
And I'm trying hard to fit among your scheme of things
It's safer than a strange land, but I still care for myself
And I don't stand in my own light
Lord, lord, my prayer flies like a word on a wing
And I'm trying hard to fit among your scheme of things
It's safer than a strange land, but I still care for myself
And I don't stand in my own light
Lord, lord, my prayer flies like a word on a wing
My prayer flies like a word on a wing
Does my prayer fit in with your scheme of things?

Working Class Hero



As soon as you're born they make you feel small
By giving you no time instead of it all
Till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be

They hurt you at home and they hit you at school
They hate you if your clever and they despise a fool
Till you're so fucking crazy you can't fallow their rules
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be

When they've tortured and scared you for 20 odd years
Then they expect you to pick a career
When you can't really function you're so full of fear
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
Keep you doped wit religion and sex and TV
And you think you're so clever and classless and free
But you're still fucking peasants as far as I can see
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be

There's room at the top they are telling you still
But first you must learn how to smile as you kill
If you want to be like the folks on the hill

A working class hero is something to be
If you want to be a hero just follow me
If you want to be a hero well just follow me

Yassassin




  Yassassin - I'm not a moody guy
  Yassassin - I walk without a sound
  Yassassin - Just a working man, no judge of men
  Yassassin - But such a life I've never known

We came from the farmlands
To live in this city
We walked proud and lustful
In this resonant world
You want to fight
But I don't want to leave
Or drift away



Look at this - no second glances
Look at this - no value of love
Look at this - just sun and steel
Look at this - then look at us

If there's someone in charge
Then listen to me
Don't say nothing's wrong
'Cause I've got a love
And she's afeared
You want to fight
But I don't want to leave
Or drift away



Yassassin, Yassassin, Yassassin

You Belong In Rock 'N Roll



Just the twinkling lights of heaven
Two reflections on the sparkling water
Hand in hand in love with love uh-huh

I love the cheap things that you say-a-say

You belong in rock 'n roll
You belong in rock 'n roll
You belong in rock 'n roll
Well so do I
I love how she moves me
It makes me feel alright, alright, alright, alright

I'm a hurt, I'm a hurt, I'm a hurting
I'm a man with a beat in my pocket
I'm going down to the rhythm of love

I love a bad look that you bring-r-ing

You belong in rock 'n roll
You belong in rock 'n roll
You belong in rock 'n roll

Well so do I
Alone on a mean street
It makes me feel on fire, on fire, on fire, on fire, on fire...

On fire, on fire, on fire, on fire, on fire

I love the cheap street in your walk, uh-huh
You belong in rock 'n roll
You belong in rock 'n roll
Well so do I
I love how she moves me
It makes me feel alright, alright, alright, alright, alright...

Oh-oh!

You Can't Talk



Beauty shrieks "Beast in booties"
Coming home so lay the table
Look at you calling shots
Call you over under out

I was under, backwards, forwards
Holding hands in the dark
Kissing some, kissing cousins
Kissing this in cover
Kissing cousins, kissing that

Over under out
Over under out
Over under out


  You can't talk
  You can't see me drowning
  You can't talk
  I don't see you swimming
  You can't talk
  You want go your way
  You can't talk
  I know you don't love me

Look at this heart's a poppin'
Guess it's over
Crazy action mine's a breakin'
Guess it's over
(Here we go)



Oh-oh-oh

Beauty shrieks 'Beast in booties'
Coming home so lay the table
Look at you calling shots
Call you over under out
I was under, backwards, forwards
Holding hands in the dark
Kissing some, kissing cousins
Kissing this

 (twice)

You can't talk (twice)
I know you don't love me (repeat ad inf)

You've Been Around



Where's the pain in the violent night?
I'm depressed by the grin
I stay over many years
I should have thought of that
For the love of the money
Like a black-hearted violin
It's the nature of being

It's too many lonely nights
I can't tell bad from wrong
I can't pass you by
Two exchanging
You've been around
But you've changed me

Where the flesh meets the spirit world
Where the traffic is thin
I slip from a vacant view
I should have thought of that
And the sound of tomorrow
Like a black-hearted vile thing
Like the silence of tension

It's too many lonely nights
I can't tell good from bad
I can't pass you by
Too exchanging
You've been around
But you've changed me

You've been around
Can't pass you by
You've been around
But you've changed me

Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-change!

Too exchanging

You've been around
                  but you've changed me
You've been around
                  can't pass you by

You've Got A Habit Of Leaving



You've got a habit of leaving me
And you've got a habit of deserting me

Sometimes I cry
Sometimes I'm so sad
Sometimes I'm so glad, so glad

You could go on if you wanted to, wanted to, wanted to
Wanted to
Oh
If you wanted to, yeah
Oh huh

You've got a habit of leaving me
And you've got a habit of deserting me

Sometimes I cry
Sometimes I'm so sad
Sometimes I'm so glad, so glad

You could go on if you wanted to, wanted, wanted to
Wanted to, ooh yeah, yeah
Oh, if you wanted to
If you wanted to, yeah, yeah
Wanted to

Young Americans



They pulled in just behind the fridge
He lays her down, he frowns
"Gee my life's a funny thing, am I still too young?"
He kissed her then and there
She took his ring, took his babies
It took him minutes, took her nowhere
Heaven knows, she'd have taken anything, but

 (SHE)
  All night
  She wants the young American
  Young American, young American, she wants the young American
  All right
  She wants the young American

Scanning life through the picture window
She finds the slinky vagabond
He coughs as he passes her Ford Mustang, but
Heaven forbid, she'll take anything
But the freak, and his type, all for nothing
He misses a step and cuts his hand, but
Showing nothing, he swoops like a song
She cries "Where have all Papa's heroes gone?"

 (SHE)

All the way from Washington
Her bread-winner begs off the bathroom floor
"We live for just these twenty years
Do we have to die for the fifty more?"

 (HE)
  All night
  He wants the young American
  Young American, young American, he wants the young American
  All right
  He wants the young American

Do you remember, your President Nixon?
Do you remember, the bills you have to pay
Or even yesterday?

Have you have been an un-American?
Just you and your idol singing falsetto 'bout
Leather, leather everywhere, and
Not a myth left from the ghetto
Well, well, well, would you carry a razor
In case, just in case of depression?
Sit on your hands on a bus of survivors
Blushing at all the afro-Sheilas
Ain't that close to love?
Well, ain't that poster love?
Well, it ain't that Barbie doll
Her heart's been broken just like you have

 (YOU)
  All night
  You want the young American
  Young American, young American, you want the young American
  All right
  You want the young American

You ain't a pimp and you ain't a hustler
A pimp's got a Cadi and a lady got a Chrysler
Black's got respect, and white's got his soul train
Mama's got cramps, and look at your hands ache
  (I heard the news today, oh boy)
I got a suite and you got defeat
Ain't there a man you can say no more?
And, ain't there a woman I can sock on the jaw?
And, ain't there a child I can hold without judging?
Ain't there a pen that will write before they die?
Ain't you proud that you've still got faces?
Ain't there one damn song that can make me
break down and cry?


  All night
  I want the young American
  Young American, young American, I want the young American
  All right
  I want the young American

Zeroes



Yeah Yeah Yeah
Yeah Yeah

You've arrived in the land of a thousand different names
Where the fabulous sons have crashed their planes in flames
Now tomorrow is back claiming redemption is on your heels
And a toothless past is asking you how it feels
And me my little red Corvette has driven by
My fair weather heart has fallen in
My rainy day girl is feeling down
And she tells me that the world is spinning round
I say the dream was all for you
You're nobody else
Tonight the Zeroes were singing for you

Yeah

Hi, can I walk you home again today
Gotta get forgive and forget hey-hey
Something good is happening I don't know what it is
Don't you know we're back on trial again today
And it's breaking wine for you
Hell it's only 'cause you're true
Someone outtimed my heart
Stopping and preaching and letting love in
You are my moon, you are my sun
Heaven knows what you are
Tonight the Zeroes are singing for you

Yes they were
Tonight the Zeroes were singing for you
Tonight the Zeroes were singing for you

Doesn't matter what you try to do
Doesn't matter what you try to do
Doesn't matter where you try to go
Doesn't matter who we really are

Ziggy Stardust



Ziggy played guitar, jamming good with Weird and Gilly
The spiders from Mars.  He played it left hand
But made it too far
Became the special man, then we were Ziggy's band

Ziggy really sang, screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan, he could lick 'em by smiling
He could leave 'em to hang
Came on so loaded man, well hung and snow white tan.

So where were the spiders while the fly tried to break our balls
Just the beer light to guide us,
So we bitched about his fans and should we crush his sweet hands?

Ziggy played for time, jiving us that we were voodoo
The kids were just crass, he was the nazz
With God given ass
He took it all too far but boy could he play guitar

Making love with his ego Ziggy sucked up into his mind
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed the man I had to break up the band.

Oh yeah
Ooooooo
Ziggy played guitaarrrrrr

1.1. Modern Love




I catch a paper boy
But things don't really change
I'm standing in the wind
But I never wave bye bye
But I try
    I try
There's no sign of life
It's just the power to charm
I'm lying in the rain
But I never wave bye bye
But I try
    I try
Never gonna fall for
	Modern love walks beside me
	Modern love walks on by
	Modern love gets me to the churck on time
Churck on time terrafies me
Churck on time makes me party
Churck on time puts my trust in God and man
	God and man no confessions
	God and man no religion
	God and man don't believe in modern love


1.2. China Girl




I could escape this feeling with my china girl
I feel a wreck without my little china girl
I hear her heart's beating loud as thunder
Saw they stars crashing
I'm a mess without my little china girl
Wake up mornings where's my little china girl
I hear her heart's beating loud as thunder
Saw they stars crashing down
I feel a-tragic like I'm marlon brando
When I look at my china girl
I could pretend that nothing really meant too much
When I look at my china girl
I stumble into town just like a sacred cow
Visions of swasticas in my head
Plans for everyone
It's in the white of my eyes
My little chine girl
You shouldn't mess with me
I'll ruin everything you are
I'll give you television
I'll give you eyes of blue
I'll give you man who wants to rule the world
And when I get excited
My little chine girl says
Oh baby just you shut your mouth
She says ... Sh-sh-shhh.


1.3. Let's Dance




Let's dance put on your red shoes and dance the blues
Let's dance to the songs they're playin' on the radio
Let's sway while colour lights up your face
Let's sway sway through the crowd to an empty space
	If you say run, I'll run with you
	If you say hide, we'll hide
	Because my love for you
	Would break my heart in two
	If you should fall
	Into my arms
	And tremble like flower
Let's dance for fear your grace should fall
Let's dance for fear tonight is all
Let's sway you could look into my eyes
Let's sway under the moonlight, this serious moonlight
	If you say run, I'll run with you
	If you say hide, we'll hide
	Because my love for you
	Would break my heart in two
	If you should fall
	Into my arms
	And tremble like flower
Let's dance put on your red shoes and dance the blues
Let's dance to the songs they're playin' on the radio
Let's sway you could look into my eyes
Let's sway under the moonlight, this serious moonlight


1.4. Without You




Just when I'm ready to throw in my hand
Just when the best things in life are gone
I look into your eyes
There's no smoke without fire
You're exactly who I want to be with
Without you
What would I do

And when I'm willing to call it a day
Just when I won't take another chance
I hold your hand
There's no smoke without fire
Woman I love you
Without you
What would I do.


1.5. Ricochet




Like weeds on a rockface waiting for the scythe
				ricochet - ricochet
The world is on a corner waiting for jobs
				ricochet - ricochet
Turn the holy pictures so they face the wall
And who can bear to be forgotten
And who can bear to be forgotten
March of flowers - march of Dimes
These are the prisons, these are the crimes
Men wait for news while thousands are still asleep
Dreaming of tramlines factories pieces of machinery
Mine shafts, things like that
March of flowers - march of dimes
These are the prisons, these are the crimes
Sound of thunder, sound of gold
Sound of the devil breaking parol
Ricochet - it's not the end of the world
Sound of thunder, sound of gold
Sound of the devil breaking parol. Ricochet - ricochet
These are the prisons, there are the creames
Teaching life in a violent new way Ricochet - ricochet
Turn the Holy pictures so they face the wall
And who can bear to be forgotten
And who can bear to be forgotten
March of flowers march of dimes
These are the prisons these are the crimes
Early, before the sun, they struggle off to the gates
In their secret fearful places they see their lives
Unravelling before them
March of flowers, march of dimes
These are the prisons, these are the crimes
Sound of thunder sound of gold
Sound of the devil breaking parol
Ricochet it's not the end of the world
But when they get home damp eyed and weary
They smile & crush their children to their heaving chesls
Making unfulfillable promises
For who can bear to be forgotten

1.6. Criminal World




You never told me of your other faces
You were the widow of a wild cat
And now I know about your special kisses
And I know you know where that's at
I guess I recognize your destination
I see beneath your make up
What you want is sort of separation
This is no ordinary
This is no ordinary
(Ah Ah Ah)
What a criminal world
The boys are like baby-faced girls
What a criminal world
She'll show you where to shoot your gun
What a typical mother son
The only thing that she enjoys
Is a criminal world
Where the girls are like baby-faced boys
You've got a very heavy reputation
But no one knows about your low-life
I know a way to found a situation
And hold a candle to your high light disquise
You cought me kneeling at your sister's door
I'm well aware just what you're looking for
I am no ordinary
I am no ordinary
(Ah, Ah, Ah)
What a criminal world
The boys are like baby-faced girls
What a criminal world
She'll show you where to shoot your gun
What a typical mother son
The only thing that she enjoys
Is a criminal world
Where the girls are like baby-faced boys


1.7. Cat People




See the eyes so green
I can sfare for the thousand years
Colder than the moon
It's been so long
And I've been putting out fire
With gasoline
See the eyes so red
Red like jungle burning bright
Those who feel me near
Pull the blinds and change their minds
It's been so long
Still the pulsing night
A plague I call heartbeat
Just be still with me
Ya wouldn't believe what I've been thru

You've been so long
Well it's been so long
And I've been putting out fire with gasoline
	      putting out fire with gasoline
See the tears so blue
An ageless heart that can never mend
These tears can never dry
A judgement made can never bend
See the eyes so green
I can stare for a thousand years
Just be still with me
You've wouldn't believe what I've been thru
You've been so long
Well it's been so long
And I've been putting out fire with gasoline
	      putting out fire with gasoline
