#chickentown by john cooper clarke.
the fucking cops are fucking keen.
to fucking keep it fucking clean.
the fucking chief's a fucking swine.
who fucking draws a fucking line.
at fucking fun and fucking games.
the fucking kids he fucking blames.
are nowehere to be fucking found.
anywhere in chicken town.
the fucking scene is fucking sad.
the fucking news is fucking bad.
the fucking weed is fucking turf.
the fucking speed is fucking surf.
the fucking folks are fucking daft.
don't make me fucking laugh.
it fucking hurts to look around.
everywhere in chicken town.
the fucking train is fucking late.
you fucking wait you fucking wait.
you're fucking lost and fucking found.
stuck in fucking chicken town.
the fucking view is fucking vile.
for fucking miles and fucking miles.
the fucking babies fucking cry.
the fucking flowers fucking die.
the fucking food is fucking muck.
the fucking drains are fucking fucked.
the colour scheme is fucking brown.
everywhere in chicken town.

the fucking pubs are fucking dull

the fucking clubs are fucking full

of fucking girls and fucking guys

with fucking murder in their eyes

a fucking bloke is fucking stabbed

waiting for a fucking cab

you fucking stay at fucking home

the fucking neighbors fucking moan

keep the fucking racket down

this is fucking chicken town

the fucking train is fucking late

you fucking wait you fucking wait

you're fucking lost and fucking found

stuck in fucking chicken town

the fucking pies are fucking old

the fucking chips are fucking cold

the fucking beer is fucking flat

the fucking flats have fucking rats

the fucking clocks are fucking wrong

the fucking days are fucking long

it fucking gets you fucking down

evidently chicken town
