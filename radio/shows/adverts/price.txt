for a monkey
five for a pound
a bag of nuts
an arm full of blood
a tiny bit of your soul
a slow handjob
that thing in your hand
some foreign coins
that thing you're smoking
a nice hat
a dovehand lesson
a massive dong
powers beyond my imagination
some warmth
tradable info morphs
a cup of tea
a fucking huge drop
one of povey's badges
something you don't have
a flying pickle
the lost fish. Where is that fish?
pambot's phone number
