The traffic heading #direction# is looking a tiny bit bollocksed, there is a #vehicle# causing a blockage in the rear canal.
What up, all you travellers out there travelling #direction#. Better watch your #vehicle#s wing-mirrors, because theres some #weather# out there.
Oh my, looks like those in #vehicle# heading towards #direction# are in for a spot of #weather#. Hold tight.
A man in a pair of dungarees is blocking traffic #direction#. To avoid him, drive your #vehicle# very bloody fast. Now: #weather#.
Its impossible to see out there. The #weather# is causing all sorts of bollocks fuckery #direction#.
#direction#. #vehicle#. #weather#.
#direction#. #vehicle#. #weather#.
#direction#. #vehicle#. #weather#.
#direction#. #vehicle#. #weather#.
#direction#. #vehicle#. #weather#.
