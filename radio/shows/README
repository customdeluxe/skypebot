landlord radio shows

a radio show consist of:

- templates
- substitution parts
- audio intro file (called intro.aiff 22.2k sample rate, mono)
- audio fill file (called fill.aiff 22.2k sample rate, mono)
- list of voices

these are all held in plain text files in subdirectories of /radio/shows

e.g. /adverts looks like this:

fill.aiff      intro.aiff     price.txt      product.txt    templates.txt  voices.txt

a template file contains lines like this:

  The finest, leather-scented, brandy-based #product# - only #price#.

strings surrounded by '#' signs are keywords, the script looks for files of these names with .txt extension (in this case price.txt and product.txt)

a show consists of:

intro
sentence 1
fill
sentence 2
fill
sentence 3
fill

if multiple voices are specified in voices.txt, one is selected at random for each sentence.
