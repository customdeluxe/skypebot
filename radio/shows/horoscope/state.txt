messed up, like uranus
glitch ee but pretty. That'll be Pluto.
drunk as a skunk. Let's take it to mars.
on the journalists sofa like it just don't care
humble but aggressive like the mars mission posse
dropped into the drop
lost on a dong
burnt by lasers
hung up on Turing
burning down the house. My house. Yeah!
done taking it to the bridge
smells like voodooo
hanging out the back with pambot
gloomy, gloomy, gloomy
weeping in the corner
